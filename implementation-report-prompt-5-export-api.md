# Implementation Report: Export API Implementation (Prompt 5)

## Summary of Changes

This report details the implementation of the backend export API as per Prompt 5. The goal was to create endpoints and service logic for generating and downloading data exports in various formats.

## Files Created

*   `server/src/controllers/exportController.js`: New controller file containing `generateExport` and `downloadExport` functions.
*   `server/src/routes/exportRoutes.js`: New routes file defining POST `/api/exports` and GET `/api/exports/:id` routes mapped to the export controller functions.
*   `server/src/services/export/exportService.js`: New service file containing `generateAndStoreExport` and `getExportFile` methods, along with helper methods for data fetching and formatting (CSV, PDF, JSON).

## Key Implementation Decisions and Reasoning

*   **Dedicated Export Module:** Created a separate controller, routes, and service file for export functionality to maintain modularity and separation of concerns.
*   **Generate and Download Endpoints:** Implemented two distinct endpoints: POST `/api/exports` to initiate the export generation and GET `/api/exports/:id` to download a previously generated file. This asynchronous approach is suitable for potentially long-running export generation tasks.
*   **Firebase Storage for Exports:** Utilized Firebase Cloud Storage to store the generated export files, leveraging its scalability and security features. Files are stored under a user-specific path (`exports/{userId}/`).
*   **Signed URLs for Download:** Generated signed URLs for download access, providing secure, time-limited access to the export files without requiring public read permissions on the storage bucket. A long expiry was set for convenience.
*   **Firestore Metadata for Exports:** Stored metadata about each generated export (userId, filename, filePath, format, reportType, createdAt, status) in a 'exports' collection in Firestore. This allows for tracking generated exports and verifying ownership before serving files.
*   **Data Fetching and Formatting:** Implemented private helper methods in the export service (`_fetchReceiptData`, `_fetchInventoryData`, `_formatAsCsv`, `_formatAsPdf`, `_formatAsJson`) to handle fetching data from Firestore and formatting it into the requested output format. Assumed the availability of `json2csv` and `pdfkit` libraries for CSV and PDF generation.
*   **Stream-Based File Handling:** Used streams for reading and writing files to/from Firebase Storage, which is efficient for handling potentially large export files.
*   **Authentication and Error Handling:** Applied authentication middleware to all export routes and implemented standard error handling patterns in the controller and service.

## Potential Improvements for Future Iterations

*   **Background Export Generation:** For very large exports, consider implementing the generation process as a Firebase Cloud Function or a background job to avoid tying up the request thread and potentially hitting request timeouts. The `generateExport` endpoint could then return a status indicating that the export is being processed.
*   **Export Status Tracking:** Enhance the export metadata in Firestore to include more detailed status updates (e.g., 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed') and potentially progress information.
*   **Export Management UI:** Develop a client-side UI to list previously generated exports, show their status, and provide download links.
*   **More Robust PDF Formatting:** The current PDF formatting is basic. More sophisticated PDF generation with better styling, tables, and inclusion of more data fields could be implemented.
*   **Support for Additional Report Types and Filters:** Extend the data fetching and formatting logic to support more report types and a wider range of filtering options.

## Challenges Encountered and How They Were Resolved

*   **Integrating PDF Generation:** Implementing PDF generation within the service required using a library (`pdfkit`) and handling streams asynchronously. This was addressed by using Promises and piping the PDF stream to the GCS upload stream.
*   **Handling File Download:** Serving the generated file for download required setting appropriate response headers and piping the file stream to the response object in the `downloadExport` controller function.

This implementation report documents the creation of the export API as part of Prompt 5, providing context for future development and potential areas for further improvement.
