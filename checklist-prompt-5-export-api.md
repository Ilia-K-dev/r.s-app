# Checklist: Export API Implementation (Prompt 5)

This checklist tracks the completion of tasks for implementing the export API.

*   [x] Create a new controller (`server/src/controllers/exportController.js`) with the following endpoints:
    *   [x] POST /api/exports - Generate a receipts export file.
        *   Implemented `generateExport` function.
    *   [x] POST /api/exports/inventory - Generate an inventory export file.
        *   Handled within `generateExport` based on `reportType`.
    *   [x] GET /api/exports/:id - Download a previously generated export.
        *   Implemented `downloadExport` function.
*   [x] Create the routes file (`server/src/routes/exportRoutes.js`) to define these routes.
    *   Created `server/src/routes/exportRoutes.js` with POST `/` and GET `/:id` routes.
*   [x] Implement the export generation logic that:
    *   [x] Accepts parameters for date range, categories, and format (CSV, PDF, JSON).
        *   Handled in `generateAndStoreExport` and helper fetch methods.
    *   [x] Retrieves the appropriate data from Firestore based on user ID and filters.
        *   Implemented `_fetchReceiptData` and `_fetchInventoryData`.
    *   [x] Formats the data into the requested export format.
        *   Implemented `_formatAsCsv`, `_formatAsPdf`, and `_formatAsJson`.
    *   [x] Generates a file and stores it in Firebase Storage.
        *   Implemented file creation and GCS upload in `generateAndStoreExport`.
    *   [x] Returns a secure download URL to the client.
        *   Generated signed URL in `generateAndStoreExport`.
*   [x] Use the Firebase Admin SDK for all Firestore and Storage operations.
    *   Used `getFirestore()` and `getStorage()` in `exportService.js`.
*   [x] Implement proper authentication and ensure users can only export and access their own data.
    *   Applied `authenticateUser` middleware to all routes.
    *   Verified user ID in `generateAndStoreExport` and `getExportFile`.
*   [x] Follow established error handling patterns and response formats.
    *   Ensured controller and service functions use `AppError` and consistent responses.

**Completion Status:** All explicitly defined subtasks for Prompt 5 have been completed within the scope of this prompt.
