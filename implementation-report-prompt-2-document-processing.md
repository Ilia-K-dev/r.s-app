# Implementation Report: Document Processing API Enhancement (Prompt 2)

## Summary of Changes

This report details the enhancements made to the backend document processing API as per Prompt 2. The focus was on improving OCR accuracy and parsing, adding a receipt correction endpoint, and implementing more comprehensive error handling.

## Files Modified

*   `server/src/controllers/documentController.js`: Added the `correctReceipt` controller function to handle requests for saving corrected receipt data.
*   `server/src/routes/documentRoutes.js`: Added a new PUT route `/correct/:id` mapped to the `correctReceipt` controller function.
*   `server/src/services/document/documentService.js`:
    *   Added the `saveCorrection` service function to handle updating documents in Firestore with corrected data and preserving original OCR results.
    *   Updated the `metadataPatterns` object with improved regex for extracting date and total from receipts.
    *   Updated the `_extractMetadata` helper function to include confidence scores for extracted fields and prioritize matches found within text blocks.
    *   Enhanced error handling in `extractTextFromGcsUri` and `classifyDocumentText` to provide more specific error messages and ensure detailed logging.

## Key Implementation Decisions and Reasoning

*   **Receipt Correction Endpoint:** A dedicated `PUT /correct/:id` endpoint was added to allow clients to submit corrected data for a specific document. Using PUT is appropriate as it represents an update to an existing resource.
*   **Storing Original OCR vs. Corrected Data:** The `saveCorrection` function is designed to store the user-provided `correctedData` separately while retaining the `originalOcrResult`. This allows for auditing and potential future improvements to the OCR model based on user corrections.
*   **Improved Metadata Extraction:** The `metadataPatterns` and `_extractMetadata` function were updated to use more robust regex patterns for common receipt fields like date and total. Prioritizing matches within text blocks (`confidence = 0.8`) over full text matches (`confidence = 0.4`) is a heuristic to improve accuracy, assuming key information is often structured in blocks.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Error handling in the service functions was refined to provide more specific `AppError` messages, including details about whether the failure originated from the Vision API or during text classification/parsing. This helps the client and developers diagnose issues more effectively. Detailed logging with stack traces is maintained for server-side debugging.

## Potential Improvements for Future Iterations

*   **More Advanced OCR Parsing:** The current regex-based parsing is limited. Implementing more sophisticated techniques, potentially involving machine learning or analyzing the spatial relationships between text blocks, could significantly improve accuracy across diverse receipt formats.
*   **Itemized List Extraction:** Extracting individual line items from receipts is a complex task not fully addressed in this prompt. This would require dedicated logic to identify patterns of item descriptions, quantities, and prices within the text blocks.
*   **Confidence Score Refinement:** The current confidence scores are simple heuristics. More advanced methods could be developed to provide more accurate confidence levels for extracted fields.
*   **Automated Retries:** For transient Vision API errors, implementing automated retry logic within `extractTextFromGcsUri` could improve the success rate without requiring client intervention.

## Challenges Encountered and How They Were Resolved

*   **`replace_in_file` Mismatches:** Encountered issues with `replace_in_file` due to subtle differences between the expected file content and the actual content, likely caused by auto-formatting or previous edits. This was resolved by carefully reviewing the provided `file_content` in the error messages and using smaller, more precise `SEARCH` blocks, and ultimately resorting to a `write_to_file` for a larger section when multiple `replace_in_file` attempts failed.

This implementation report documents the enhancements made to the document processing API as part of Prompt 2, providing context for future development and potential areas for further improvement.
