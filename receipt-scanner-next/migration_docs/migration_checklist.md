## Learnings and Notes for Next Cline

- **Event Handling Debugging:** Encountered a significant issue where browser automation tool clicks were not triggering event handlers in the frontend. Debugging involved adding extensive `console.log` statements to components and manually testing in the browser.
- **API Client `baseURL` Issue:** Discovered that the configured `baseURL` for the Axios instance was not being applied, causing API requests to go to the frontend's origin. Debugging involved adding `console.log` to check environment variable loading and analyzing network requests in the browser console.
- **Backend Dependency:** Progress on API client setup and feature migration is blocked by the need for a functional `/api/receipts` endpoint on the backend.
- **Tools/Techniques Used:**
    - Manual browser testing (essential for debugging when automation failed).
    - Extensive `console.log` for tracing code execution and variable values.
    - Browser developer console (Console and Network tabs) for observing logs and network requests.
    - Analyzing backend route definitions (`server/src/routes/receiptRoutes.js`, `server/src/app.js`) to understand expected API endpoints.
    - Examining frontend API service and configuration files (`client/src/features/receipts/services/receipts.js`, `client/src/shared/services/api.js`, `client/src/core/config/api.config.js`) to understand API call construction and environment variable usage.

## Summary of Progress

**Work Completed So Far:**

We have successfully set up a minimal Next.js project, created initial documentation files for project inventory (though not yet populated), installed dependencies, configured environment variables, set up basic folder structure, and configured Tailwind CSS.

We have also made significant progress on core infrastructure, including setting up basic Firebase authentication with context and middleware, implementing the login and registration forms and integrating them with Firebase authentication. We have also completed the basic Redux setup, including creating the store, a receipts slice, a store provider, and integrating it into the application layout. We have also updated the ReceiptList component to use Redux state for data, loading, and error handling.

We have also started documenting changes in the `migration_log.md` file and added documentation comments to modified files.

**What is Left to Do:**

Many tasks from the migration plan are still pending, including fully populating the project inventory documentation, completing the Next.js configuration for React Native Web (transpilation, path aliases), fully implementing and testing the authentication flow, refining the API client setup, and migrating all the features (Receipt Scanning, Inventory Management, Analytics). We also need to set up navigation components, perform performance optimizations, conduct thorough cross-platform testing, and finalize documentation and production build configurations.

**What I Was Doing When Interrupted:**

When interrupted, I was in the process of testing the authentication flow in the browser after implementing the login and registration forms. I encountered issues where the forms were not redirecting or showing errors, leading me to add logging to the components to diagnose the problem.

**How I Plan on Doing It:**

My plan is to continue following the provided migration plan incrementally. My immediate next step is to resume debugging the authentication flow based on the logging I added. I will launch the browser at the registration page again, attempt to register a user, and carefully examine the browser's console logs for the output of the `console.log` and `console.error` statements. Based on the logs, I will diagnose why the `handleSubmit` function was not executing or why the Firebase calls were not succeeding.

Once the registration is working, I will test the login flow similarly. After confirming that both login and registration are functioning correctly and redirecting as expected, I will update the migration log file to document the completed authentication setup and testing.

Then, I will proceed with the next tasks in the migration plan, likely focusing on refining the API client setup or continuing with the migration of the Receipt Management feature, integrating the API client and Redux more fully as needed, while continuing to document progress in the migration log and file comments.
