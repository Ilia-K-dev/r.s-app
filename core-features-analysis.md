# Receipt Scanner App - Core Feature Analysis

This document analyzes the implementation and status of the core features in the Receipt Scanner application.

## 1. Document Scanning and OCR

*   **Capture & Processing:**
    *   Documents (likely images of receipts) are captured on the client-side using components like `client/src/features/documents/components/FileUploader.js` (potentially leveraging `react-dropzone`) and possibly native device capabilities via `expo-image-picker` or `react-native-vision-camera` if native features are used.
    *   Client-side hooks like `useDocumentScanner.js` likely manage the capture flow.
    *   Uploaded images are sent to the server (handled by `multer` middleware).
    *   Server-side pre-processing might occur using `sharp` (`server/src/services/preprocessing.js`) to optimize images before OCR.
*   **OCR Technology:**
    *   The primary OCR engine appears to be **Google Cloud Vision API**, integrated via the `@google-cloud/vision` library on the server (`server/config/vision.js`, `server/src/services/document/documentProcessingService.js`, `server/src/services/document/visionService.js`).
    *   **Tesseract.js** is included in the client dependencies, suggesting it might be used for optional client-side OCR previews (`client/src/features/documents/hooks/useOCR.js`) or as a fallback, but Google Vision is likely used for the main, more accurate processing on the backend.
*   **Data Extraction & Structure:**
    *   The server-side `documentProcessingService.js` orchestrates the OCR process using Google Vision.
    *   Extracted text and potentially structured data (like line items, total, date) from the Vision API response are likely processed and mapped to the `Receipt` model (`server/src/models/Receipt.js`).
    *   The `receiptController.js` handles saving this structured data, probably to Firestore.
    *   Client displays previews using components like `DocumentPreview.js` and `ReceiptPreview.js`.
*   **Status:** **Complete / In-Progress.** The core infrastructure using Google Cloud Vision on the backend seems established. Client-side integration and potential Tesseract usage might still be under refinement.

## 2. Receipt Management

*   **Data Model & Storage:**
    *   Receipt data is defined by the `server/src/models/Receipt.js` model, likely including fields for vendor, date, total amount, line items (potentially referencing `Product.js`), category (`Category.js`), and the user ID.
    *   Storage is managed server-side, almost certainly using **Firestore** via the `firebase-admin` SDK, linked to the user's account.
    *   Categories are managed separately (`server/src/models/Category.js`, `categoryController.js`).
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Viewing:** `Receiptlist.js`, `ReceiptCard.js`, `ReceiptDetail.js`, `ReceiptDetailPage.js`.
    *   **Editing/Creating:** `ReceiptForm.js`, `ReceiptEdit.js`.
    *   **Filtering/Searching:** `ReceiptFilters.js`, `SearchBar.js` (shared).
    *   **Hooks:** `useReceipts.js` (client-side) likely fetches and manages receipt data state.
*   **Categories & Items:**
    *   Users can likely manage categories via `CategorySettings.js` (`client/src/features/settings/components/`).
    *   Receipts are associated with categories (link established in `Receipt.js` model).
    *   Line items within receipts are likely stored as an array of objects within the Receipt document in Firestore.
*   **Status:** **Complete.** This appears to be a central and well-developed feature with dedicated components for CRUD operations and display.

## 3. Inventory Tracking

*   **Data Structure:**
    *   Core models include `Inventory.js` (likely representing overall inventory state or specific items), `Product.js` (defining product details), `StockMovement.js` (tracking additions/removals), and `InventoryAlert.js` (for low stock notifications).
    *   Data is stored server-side, likely in **Firestore**, linked to user accounts.
*   **Stock Management:**
    *   Client-side components (`InventoryList.js`, `InventoryItem.js`, `StockManager.js`) allow users to view and manage inventory levels.
    *   Hooks like `useInventory.js` and `useStockManagement.js` manage client state and interactions.
    *   Server-side logic (`inventoryController.js`, `server/src/services/inventory/stockService.js`, `server/src/utils/stockCalculations.js`) handles updates based on stock movements (e.g., adding items from receipts, manual adjustments).
    *   Alerts for low stock are managed via `StockAlerts.js` (client) and `alertController.js` / `server/src/services/alert/` (server).
*   **Item Tracking:**
    *   Tracking seems based on recording stock movements (`StockMovement.js`) rather than just overwriting quantities, allowing for history/auditing. Products are likely identified uniquely.
*   **Status:** **Complete / In-Progress.** The data models and core components for viewing and managing stock seem present. The link between receipt processing and automatic stock updates might still be under development or refinement.

## 4. Analytics and Reporting

*   **Charts & Visualization:**
    *   Multiple chart components exist: `SpendingChart.js`, `CategoryBreakdown.js`, `SpendingTrends.js`, `BudgetProgress.js`, shared components like `DonutChart.js`, `ChartWrapper.js`.
    *   Libraries used: `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`, `recharts`.
    *   Dashboard components (`AnalyticsDashboard.js`, `DashboardStats.js`, `SpendingSummary.js`) aggregate visualizations.
*   **Data Aggregation & Calculation:**
    *   Client-side hooks (`useAnalytics.js`, `useReports.js`) and utility functions (`analyticsCalculations.js`) likely handle fetching pre-aggregated data or performing some client-side calculations for display.
    *   Primary data aggregation likely occurs on the **server-side** (`analyticsController.js`, `reportController.js`, `server/src/services/analytics/`, `server/src/services/report/`) potentially using Firestore queries or scheduled Cloud Functions to process receipt data into summaries.
*   **Report Generation:**
    *   Specific report views exist (`CategoryReportPage.js`, `BudgetAnalysis.js`).
    *   The backend provides dedicated endpoints (`analyticsRoutes.js`, `reportRoutes.js`) to serve aggregated data for these reports and dashboard components.
*   **Status:** **Complete.** A significant number of components and dedicated services/controllers exist, indicating a well-developed analytics and reporting feature set.
