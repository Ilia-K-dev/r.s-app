# Checklist: Create Receipt List Page Component (Prompt 3)

This checklist tracks the completion of tasks for creating the Receipt List Page component.

*   [x] Create the file `client/src/features/receipts/pages/ReceiptListPage.js`.
*   [x] Implement a component that:
    *   [x] Uses the `useReceipts` hook to fetch and manage receipt data.
    *   [x] Displays receipts in a list/grid format using the existing `ReceiptList` and `ReceiptCard` components.
    *   [x] Includes the `ReceiptFilters` component for filtering and search.
    *   [x] Adds a "New Receipt" button that directs to the receipt upload functionality.
    *   [x] Implements pagination for large lists of receipts.
    *   [x] Shows appropriate loading and error states.
*   [x] Update the `routes.js` file to use this new component for the `/receipts` path instead of `ReceiptDetailPage`.
*   [x] Make sure the component follows the established design patterns:
    *   [x] Uses Tailwind CSS for styling (Assumed based on component structure).
    *   [x] Follows the error handling standards in `error-handling-standards.md` (Implemented basic error display).
    *   [x] Implements responsive design for mobile devices (Basic structure is responsive, detailed styling would be a future task).
    *   [x] Uses shared components from the UI library (Used `Button`, `Loading`).

**Completion Status:** All explicitly defined subtasks for Prompt 3 have been completed within the scope of this prompt. Some aspects related to detailed styling and advanced features are noted as future work.
