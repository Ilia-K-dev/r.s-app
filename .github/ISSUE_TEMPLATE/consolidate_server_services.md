**Task Description**
Analyze the existing backend services (`server/src/services/`) to identify areas of overlapping functionality or redundancy. Refactor these services to improve code organization, reduce duplication, and enhance maintainability.

**Goals**
- Identify services with similar responsibilities (e.g., multiple services interacting with the same database collection, similar validation logic).
- Merge or refactor overlapping services into more cohesive units.
- Ensure clear separation of concerns between services.
- Update controllers and other dependent code to use the refactored services.

**Potential Areas (Initial Thoughts - Requires Investigation)**
- Review services related to Receipts, Documents, and OCR.
- Examine Inventory and Stock tracking services.
- Check Analytics and Reporting services for overlap.
- Look for duplicated validation logic across different service files.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Overlapping/redundant services are identified and documented.
- [ ] Services are refactored/merged according to a clear plan.
- [ ] Code duplication is significantly reduced.
- [ ] Backend API endpoints function correctly after the refactoring.
- [ ] Unit tests are updated or added for the refactored services.
- [ ] Documentation (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api.md`) is updated if necessary.

**Additional Context**
Add any specific examples of suspected overlap or context relevant to this refactoring.
