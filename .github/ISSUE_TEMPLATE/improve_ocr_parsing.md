**Task Description**
Improve the robustness of the OCR result parsing logic within the backend service (`server/src/services/document/visionService.js` or similar). This involves handling various receipt formats, potential OCR errors, and edge cases more effectively.

**Goals**
- Improve extraction accuracy for key fields (total amount, date, vendor name, line items).
- Handle variations in receipt layouts and formats gracefully.
- Implement better error handling for cases where OCR fails or returns ambiguous results.
- Add logic to cross-validate extracted fields where possible (e.g., sum of line items vs. total).
- Consider using fuzzy matching or pattern recognition for vendor names or specific items.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Parsing logic is updated to handle common receipt variations identified.
- [ ] Error handling for OCR failures or low-confidence results is improved.
- [ ] Accuracy metrics (if available) show improvement on a test set of receipts.
- [ ] Code is well-commented, explaining the parsing strategies.
- [ ] Unit tests are added or updated to cover new parsing logic and edge cases.

**Additional Context**
Add specific examples of receipts that are currently parsed poorly, or specific parsing challenges encountered.
