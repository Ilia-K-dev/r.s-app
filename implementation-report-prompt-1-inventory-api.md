# Implementation Report: Implement Backend Inventory API Endpoints (Prompt 1)

## Summary of Changes

This report details the implementation and updates made to the backend inventory API endpoints as per Prompt 1. The goal was to create a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing inventory items and stock movements, ensuring they align with the refactored client-side service and use the Firebase Admin SDK.

## Files Modified

*   `server/src/controllers/inventoryController.js`: Added new controller functions for getting a single product, deleting a product, creating a stock movement, and getting low stock alerts.
*   `server/src/routes/inventoryRoutes.js`: Updated existing routes and added new routes to align with the requested `/api/inventory` base path and include endpoints for the new controller functions. The method for the stock update route was changed from POST to PUT.

## Key Implementation Decisions and Reasoning

*   **Endpoint Paths and Methods:** The routes in `server/src/routes/inventoryRoutes.js` were updated to use the `/api/inventory` base path and the specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) requested in the prompt. This provides a clear and consistent API surface for inventory management.
*   **New Controller Functions:** Added `getProductById`, `deleteProduct`, `createStockMovement`, and `getLowStockAlerts` functions to `server/src/controllers/inventoryController.js` to handle the logic for the newly defined routes.
*   **Firebase Admin SDK Usage:** Verified that the `Product` and `StockMovement` models, which are used by the inventory controller, correctly utilize the Firebase Admin SDK (`db` object obtained from `../../config/firebase`). This ensures server-side operations have the necessary privileges and bypass client-side security rules.
*   **Authentication Middleware:** Confirmed that the `authenticateUser` middleware is applied to all inventory routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their own inventory data.
*   **Error Handling:** Ensured that the new controller functions follow the established error handling pattern using `AppError` and `next(error)` for consistent error responses.
*   **Documentation Comments:** Added basic JSDoc comments to the newly added controller functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.

## Potential Improvements for Future Iterations

*   **Input Validation:** While basic validation is present in `inventoryRoutes.js`, more comprehensive validation could be added within the controller or a dedicated validation layer to handle edge cases and complex data structures.
*   **Service Layer:** The current implementation directly interacts with models in the controller. Introducing a dedicated service layer between the controller and models could further improve separation of concerns and testability.
*   **Pagination and Filtering:** The `getProducts` and `getStockMovements` functions currently fetch all data for a user and then perform filtering/sorting in memory. For large datasets, implementing server-side pagination and more efficient filtering directly in Firestore queries would be beneficial (partially addressed in Prompt 8).
*   **Batch Operations:** The original `inventoryRoutes.js` included routes for batch updates and imports. These were commented out as they were not explicitly requested in Prompt 1, but they should be reviewed and potentially re-implemented if needed by the client.

## Challenges Encountered and How They Were Resolved

*   **Mapping Existing Functionality to New Endpoints:** Identifying which existing controller functions corresponded to the requested endpoints required careful review of both the prompt and the existing code. This was resolved by reading the controller and routes files and comparing their functionality to the prompt's requirements.
*   **Ensuring Admin SDK Usage:** While the prompt specified using the Admin SDK, verifying this required examining the model files (`Product.js` and `StockMovement.js`) to confirm they were correctly importing and using the `db` object from the server-side Firebase configuration.

This implementation report documents the changes made to the backend inventory API endpoints as part of Prompt 1, providing context for future development and maintenance.
