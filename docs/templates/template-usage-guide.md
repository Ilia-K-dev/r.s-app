# Documentation Template Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to use the documentation templates available in the `/docs/templates/` directory. These templates are designed to ensure consistency and completeness across the project's documentation.

## When to Use Each Template

- **`architecture-template.md`**: Use this template to document the architecture of a major system component, module, or the overall application. This includes high-level design, principles, structure, data flow, and considerations for security and performance.
- **`feature-template.md`**: Use this template to document a specific application feature. This should cover the feature's purpose, user stories, functional requirements, technical implementation details, UI components, and testing strategy.
- **`api-template.md`**: Use this template to document a specific API endpoint or service, whether it's a REST endpoint, a function call, or an external service integration. Include details on the endpoint, request/response formats, authentication, and error handling.
- **`implementation-template.md`**: Use this template to document the detailed implementation of a specific code component, module, or service. Focus on code structure, dependencies, key logic, data structures, and testing approach.
- **`workflow-template.md`**: Use this template to document a specific process or workflow within the application, such as the document processing workflow or the authentication flow. Describe the trigger, steps, data flow, and error handling within the workflow.

## Required vs. Optional Sections

Each template includes a set of suggested sections. While the "Overview" and main heading section (e.g., "# [Architecture Component] Architecture") are generally required, the necessity of other sections may vary depending on the specific document you are creating.

- **Required Sections:** Always include sections that are directly relevant to the topic you are documenting and are essential for understanding it. For example, an API document *must* include details on the Endpoint, Request, and Response.
- **Optional Sections:** Include optional sections (like "Future Considerations" or "Related Files") when they provide valuable context or information. If a section is not applicable to your document, you can omit it.

## How to Fill in Metadata

Each template starts with a YAML front matter block (`---` at the beginning and end). This block contains metadata about the document.

- **`title`**: The title of the document. Use a clear and descriptive title.
- **`creation_date`**: The date and time the document was initially created. Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- **`update_history`**: A list of significant updates made to the document. Each entry should include the `date` of the update and a brief `description` of the changes. Add a new entry for each major revision.
- **`status`**: The current status of the document (e.g., "Draft", "In Progress", "Completed", "Outdated").
- **`owner`**: The primary maintainer or owner of the document.
- **`related_files`**: A list of paths to related code files or other documentation documents.

Fill in the bracketed placeholders (e.g., `[Architecture Component]`) with the specific details for your document.

## Examples of Good Documentation

Refer to existing well-written documentation files in the repository for examples of how to effectively use markdown, structure content, and provide clear explanations. Pay attention to:

- **Clear and Concise Language:** Use simple and direct language. Avoid jargon where possible or explain it clearly.
- **Code Examples:** Include code examples where relevant to illustrate technical concepts or API usage. Use markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- **Diagrams:** Use diagrams (like Mermaid diagrams) to visualize complex structures, data flows, or workflows.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document, including headings, lists, and code blocks.
- **Cross-referencing:** Use links to refer to related documents or code files.

By following these guidelines and utilizing the provided templates, you can contribute to creating comprehensive and consistent documentation for the project.
