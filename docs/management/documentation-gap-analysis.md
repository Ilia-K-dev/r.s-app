# Documentation Gap Analysis

| Component/Feature | Code Location | Existing Documentation | Gap Severity | Description | Recommended Action |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Client-side Direct Firebase Access | client/src/features/*/services/*.js | docs/developer/architecture/firebase-direct-integration.md | Major | Feature-specific documentation does not fully detail implications and patterns of direct Firebase SDK usage. | Update feature documentation to include guidance on direct Firebase access. |
| Server Service Redundancy | server/src/services/inventory/*, server/src/services/document/* | Limited/Fragmented | Major | Overlapping responsibilities and unclear roles between some server-side services (e.g., Inventory, Document Processing). | Consolidate redundant services and update documentation to reflect clear responsibilities. |
| OCR Parsing Robustness | server/src/services/document/DocumentProcessingService.js, server/src/services/receipts/ReceiptProcessingService.js | client/extra/6-OCR and Document Scanning.md | Major | Documentation and implementation rely heavily on regex for parsing, which is brittle. | Document limitations of current parsing and outline plans for more robust methods (e.g., using bounding boxes). |
| Authentication Token Strategy | client/src/features/auth/services/authService.js, server/src/controllers/authController.js, server/src/middleware/auth/auth.js | client/extra/3-Authentication System.md | Major | Confusing mix of Firebase ID tokens and server-generated custom tokens with unclear rationale. | Document the intended token strategy clearly and justify the use of custom tokens if necessary. |
| Missing Stock Movement Tracking (Client) | client/src/features/inventory/hooks/useStockManagement.js | client/extra/8-Inventory Tracking.md | Major | Client-side stock updates via UI do not appear to trigger server-side stock movement record creation. | Document the correct workflow for stock updates, ensuring server-side tracking. |
| Offline Capabilities | client/src/utils/offline/* | docs/developer/architecture/firebase-direct-integration.md | Major | While mentioned, dedicated documentation on how offline data access and synchronization work across features is needed. | Create comprehensive documentation for offline capabilities and synchronization logic. |
| Consistent Error Handling Patterns | client/src/utils/errorHandler.js, client/src/features/*/services/*.js | docs/developer/guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md, docs/developer/guides/firebase-error-handling.md | Major | Documentation on consistent error handling patterns across all features, especially with feature toggle fallback, is needed. | Document standardized error handling patterns and integration with the feature toggle system. |
| Testing Environment Troubleshooting | rules-test/, server/tests/security/, client/tests/integration/ | docs/known-issues.md, docs/firebase-testing-guide.md, docs/firebase-testing.md | Major | Persistent testing environment issues are noted, but detailed troubleshooting documentation is lacking. | Create a dedicated troubleshooting guide for setting up and running the testing environment. |
| Next.js Project Status and Purpose | receipt-scanner-next/ | docs/project-structure.md | Major | The Next.js project's purpose, status, and relationship to the main project are not clearly documented. | Add detailed documentation explaining the Next.js project and its role. |
| `client/extra/` Directory Content | client/extra/ | None | Minor | The purpose and status of various files (including old docs) in the `client/extra/` directory are unclear. | Document the purpose of the `client/extra/` directory and the status of its contents, or archive/remove unnecessary files. |
| Feature Toggle Integration Details | client/src/features/*/services/*.js | docs/developer/guides/feature-toggle-system.md | Minor | While the feature toggle system is documented, specific integration details within each refactored service might be missing. | Add specific examples and details of feature toggle integration within the documentation for each refactored service. |
| UI Component Usage Details | client/src/components/, client/src/shared/components/ | docs/developer/guides/guide-ui-component-usage.md | Minor | Documentation on the usage and props of key reusable UI components might be incomplete. | Enhance documentation for reusable UI components with detailed usage examples and prop descriptions. |
| API Endpoint Specifications | server/src/routes/* | docs/developer/specifications/specification-api.md | Minor | While a comprehensive API doc exists, detailed specifications for all current API endpoints might need updating or expansion. | Review and update the API documentation to ensure all current endpoints are accurately specified. |
