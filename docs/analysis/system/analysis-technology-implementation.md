This document outlines the key technology implementations within the Receipt Scanner application.

## 1. Major Third-Party Libraries & Purpose

**Client-Side (`client/package.json`):**

*   **`react` / `react-native` / `react-dom`:** Core libraries for building the user interface (web and potentially native).
*   **`expo`:** Framework and platform for universal React applications (build, deploy, tooling).
*   **`firebase`:** Client-side SDK for interacting with Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage).
*   **`axios`:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
*   **`@react-navigation/*`:** Libraries for handling navigation within the application (stack navigator).
*   **`tailwindcss`:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the UI.
*   **`@headlessui/react` / `@heroicons/react`:** UI component primitives and icon set.
*   **`chart.js` / `react-chartjs-2` / `recharts`:** Libraries for creating charts and data visualizations.
*   **`date-fns`:** Utility library for date manipulation.
*   **`tesseract.js`:** Client-side OCR library (potentially for preview or basic processing).
*   **`react-dropzone`:** Component for handling file drag-and-drop uploads.
*   **`expo-image-picker`:** Expo module for accessing the device's image library or camera.

**Server-Side (`server/package.json`):**

*   **`express`:** Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the REST API.
*   **`firebase-admin`:** Server-side SDK for interacting with Firebase services with admin privileges.
*   **`@google-cloud/vision`:** Google Cloud Vision API client library for advanced OCR and image analysis.
*   **`axios`:** Used for making HTTP requests from the server (e.g., to external services).
*   **`body-parser`:** Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
*   **`cors`:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **`dotenv`:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **`express-rate-limit`:** Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express.
*   **`express-validator`:** Middleware for request data validation.
*   **`helmet`:** Helps secure Express apps with various HTTP headers.
*   **`morgan`:** HTTP request logger middleware.
*   **`multer`:** Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads.
*   **`sharp`:** High-performance image processing library for Node.js.
*   **`winston`:** Logging library.
*   **`@sendgrid/mail`:** Library for sending emails via SendGrid (likely for notifications or password resets).

## 2. Firebase Authentication Implementation

*   **Client-Side:**
    *   **Context:** `client/src/core/contexts/AuthContext.js` likely manages the global authentication state (current user, loading status, tokens) using React Context API. It wraps the application to provide auth state to components.
    *   **Hooks:** Custom hooks might exist within `client/src/features/auth/hooks/` or `client/src/shared/hooks/` to interact with the `AuthContext` or Firebase Auth SDK directly (e.g., `useAuth`).
    *   **Components:**
        *   Login/Registration pages/components are located in `client/src/features/auth/components/` (e.g., `LoginPage.js`, `RegisterPage.js`). These components use Firebase SDK functions (`signInWithEmailAndPassword`, `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`) possibly via the AuthContext or a dedicated service.
        *   `AuthGuard.js` (`client/src/features/auth/components/AuthGuard.js`) likely protects routes, redirecting unauthenticated users.
    *   **Flow:**
        1.  User interacts with Login/Register components.
        2.  Firebase Client SDK methods are called to authenticate.
        3.  On successful authentication, Firebase provides user information and an ID token (JWT).
        4.  `AuthContext` is updated with the user state and token.
        5.  The ID token is stored (likely in local storage via `useLocalStorage` hook or similar) and attached to subsequent API requests.
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   **Verification:** Middleware like `server/src/middleware/auth/auth.js` intercepts incoming API requests. It extracts the Firebase ID token from the `Authorization` header.
    *   **Admin SDK:** The middleware uses `firebase-admin`'s `auth().verifyIdToken()` method to verify the token's validity and signature against Firebase servers.
    *   **User Data:** If the token is valid, the decoded user information (UID, email, etc.) is attached to the request object (e.g., `req.user`) for use in controllers.
    *   **Storage:** Basic user identity is managed by Firebase Authentication. Additional user profile data might be stored in Firestore, likely linked by the Firebase UID, managed via the `server/src/models/User.js` model and `server/src/controllers/authController.js`.

## 3. API Integration Approach

*   **Client-Side:**
    *   **Structure:** API calls are primarily made using `axios`. A centralized `axios` instance is likely configured in `client/src/shared/services/api.js` or `client/src/core/config/api.config.js`. This instance might set the base URL for the backend server.
    *   **Services:** Feature-specific API calls might be encapsulated within service files (e.g., `client/src/features/receipts/services/receipts.js`, `client/src/features/inventory/services/inventoryService.js`).
    *   **Interceptors:** The central `axios` instance likely uses interceptors (`axios.interceptors.request.use(...)`) to automatically attach the Firebase ID token (retrieved from storage or AuthContext) to the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header of outgoing requests. Error handling interceptors (`axios.interceptors.response.use(...)`) might also be present for global error management (e.g., handling 401 Unauthorized).
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   **Routing:** `Express` framework defines API routes in `server/src/routes/` (e.g., `authRoutes.js`, `receiptRoutes.js`).
    *   **Controllers:** Route handlers delegate business logic to controllers in `server/src/controllers/`.
    *   **Middleware:** Various middleware functions are used:
        *   `cors` for enabling cross-origin requests from the client.
        *   `body-parser` (or `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`) for parsing request bodies.
        *   `morgan` for logging requests.
        *   `helmet` for security headers.
        *   Custom authentication middleware (`server/src/middleware/auth/auth.js`) verifies Firebase tokens.
        *   Validation middleware (`express-validator`) likely used within routes or controllers to validate incoming data.
        *   `multer` for handling file uploads on specific routes.

## 4. UI Component System

*   **Libraries:**
    *   `@headlessui/react`: Provides unstyled, accessible UI component primitives (like Modals, Menus) that are likely styled using Tailwind.
    *   `@heroicons/react`: Used for incorporating SVG icons into the UI.
*   **Custom Components:** A system of custom, reusable UI components likely exists in `client/src/shared/components/ui/` (e.g., `Card.js`, `Table.js`, `SearchBar.js`) and `client/src/shared/components/forms/` (e.g., `Input.js`). These components probably leverage Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   **Styling:** `tailwindcss` is the primary styling approach, configured via `client/tailwind.config.js` and applied using utility classes directly in the component JSX. Global styles might be defined in `client/src/styles/tailwind.css`.
*   **Charting:** `chart.js` / `react-chartjs-2` and potentially `recharts` are used for data visualization components found in `client/src/shared/components/charts/` and within the `analytics` feature.
