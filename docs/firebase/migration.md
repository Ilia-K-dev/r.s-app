## Overview

This document outlines the process, challenges, and solutions involved in migrating the Receipt Scanner application from a backend-dependent architecture to a direct Firebase integration approach.

## Detailed Migration Process

[Describe the step-by-step process that was followed for the migration.]

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

[Detail the challenges encountered during the migration and how they were addressed.]

## Feature Flag Implementation

The feature flag system is a critical component of the Firebase direct integration migration strategy. It allows for fine-grained control over which parts of the application use the new direct Firebase integration and which still rely on the legacy Express backend API.

Key aspects of using feature flags in the migration:

-   **Gradual Rollout:** New features or updates using direct Firebase calls can be initially disabled and then gradually enabled for specific user groups or environments. This minimizes the risk of introducing breaking changes to all users simultaneously.
-   **Emergency Rollback:** If issues are detected after enabling a feature flag, it can be quickly disabled via the Admin UI without requiring a new code deployment. This provides an immediate rollback mechanism.
-   **A/B Testing:** Feature flags can be used to direct different user segments to different implementations (Firebase vs. API) to compare performance, stability, or user experience.
-   **Controlled Transition:** Each service or major functional area can have its own feature flag, allowing the migration to be tackled incrementally.

For detailed information on the feature flag system implementation, usage, and management, refer to the [Feature Toggle System Documentation](../../developer/guides/feature-toggle-system.md).

## Testing Approach During Migration

[Describe the testing strategy and specific tests performed during the migration process.]

## Rollback Procedures

[Outline the procedures for rolling back the migration if necessary.]
