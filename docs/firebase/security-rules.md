## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the Firebase Security Rules implemented for Cloud Firestore and Firebase Storage in the Receipt Scanner application, along with the approach to testing these rules.

## Firestore Security Rules

[Provide complete documentation of the Firestore security rules, explaining the logic and conditions for allowing or denying read and write access to collections and documents.]

## Firebase Storage Security Rules

[Provide complete documentation of the Firebase Storage security rules, explaining the logic and conditions for allowing or denying file upload and download access.]

## Common Rule Patterns

[Describe common patterns used in the security rules (e.g., authenticated access, owner-based access, role-based access).]

## Security Rule Testing Approach

The security rules for both Firestore and Storage are rigorously tested using automated unit and integration tests. **Comprehensive test coverage has been implemented for all defined rules**, including authentication, authorization, data validation, and cross-service constraints.

The automated tests are located in `server/tests/security/firestore.test.js` and `server/tests/security/storage.test.js`. They are executed using the Firebase Emulator suite to ensure accurate and isolated testing without affecting production data.

For detailed instructions on setting up the testing environment, adding new tests, and running the automated security tests, please refer to the [Firebase Testing Documentation](./testing.md).
