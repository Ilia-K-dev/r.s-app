# Application Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Receipt Scanner application.

## Overview

The application follows a standard client-server architecture:

- **Client**: A React-based frontend responsible for user interface and interaction.
- **Server**: A Node.js/Express backend API that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with external services (Firebase, Google Cloud Vision).
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore is used for storing user data, receipts, inventory, etc.
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage is used for storing scanned receipt images.
- **External Services**:
    - Firebase Authentication for user management.
    - Google Cloud Vision API for OCR.

## Components

### Frontend (Client)

- **UI Components**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: (Specify state management library if used, e.g., Context API, Redux)
- **Routing**: (Specify routing library if used, e.g., React Router)
- **API Interaction**: Communicates with the backend API via RESTful endpoints.

### Backend (Server)

- **API Endpoints**: Exposed via Express.js routes.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and orchestrate responses.
- **Services**: Contain business logic for features like OCR processing, data validation, inventory updates, etc.
- **Middleware**: Used for authentication, request validation, error handling, etc.
- **Database Interaction**: Uses Firebase Admin SDK to interact with Firestore and Storage.
