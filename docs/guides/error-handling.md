# Error Handling Guide

[Home](/docs) > [Guides](/docs/guides) > Error Handling Guide

## Introduction

Effective error handling is crucial for building robust and maintainable applications. In the Receipt Scanner application, we follow a centralized approach to error handling to ensure consistency, provide informative feedback to users, and enable proactive monitoring and debugging.

## Centralized Error Handling Utility

All application errors, particularly those related to Firebase operations or feature-flagged functionality, should be processed through the centralized error handling utility located at `client/src/utils/errorHandler.js`.

This utility provides the following capabilities:

-   **Consistent Error Processing:** Provides a single point for handling different types of errors (Firebase errors, standard JavaScript errors, etc.).
-   **User-Friendly Messages:** Maps technical error codes (especially Firebase error codes) to more understandable messages for the user interface.
-   **Contextual Logging:** Logs errors to the console (and ideally to a dedicated error tracking service) with relevant context, including the location where the error occurred and the state of associated feature flags.
-   **Automatic Fallback/Disabling:** Integrates with the feature flag system to automatically disable feature flags that are experiencing persistent errors.

## Integration with Feature Flags and Automatic Disabling

The error handling utility is tightly integrated with the feature flag system to enhance the resilience of feature-flagged implementations.

-   **Error Tracking per Feature Flag:** The `handleError` function in `errorHandler.js` can track consecutive errors associated with a specific feature flag. When calling `handleError`, you can provide the name of the feature flag (`featureName` parameter) that was active during the operation that failed.
-   **Automatic Flag Disabling:** If a feature flag is enabled and an operation associated with it fails, the error handler increments an internal counter for that feature flag. If the number of consecutive errors for that flag reaches a predefined `ERROR_THRESHOLD`, the feature flag is automatically disabled using the `disableFeature` function from `featureFlags.js`.
-   **Automatic Fallback Message:** When a feature flag is automatically disabled due to errors, the `handleError` function returns a specific "automatic fallback" message to the user, indicating that persistent issues were detected and the application has switched to a stable alternative (e.g., the legacy API).
-   **Notifications:** A console warning is logged when a feature flag is automatically disabled. *Note: For production, this should trigger alerts to monitoring systems.*
-   **Gradual Recovery (Placeholder):** A mechanism for gradually re-enabling auto-disabled flags after a period of time to check if the underlying issue is resolved is planned but not yet implemented.

This automatic disabling system provides a crucial safety net, allowing the application to gracefully degrade and switch to a known stable state if a new feature-flagged implementation introduces unexpected errors in production.

## Using the `handleError` Function

Services and components should use the `handleError` function to process errors:

```javascript
import { handleError } from '../../../utils/errorHandler';

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Feature-flagged operation
    if (isFeatureEnabled('firebaseDirectIntegration')) {
      // Firebase logic
      await firebaseOperation();
    } else {
      // API logic
      await apiOperation();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error using the centralized utility
    const userMessage = handleError(error, 'Data Fetching Service', 'firebaseDirectIntegration');
    // Display userMessage to the user
    alert(userMessage);
  }
}
```

-   The first argument is the `error` object.
-   The second argument (`context`) is an optional string providing context about where the error occurred (e.g., service name, function name).
-   The third argument (`featureName`) is the optional name of the feature flag associated with the failed operation. Provide this when the error is related to a feature-flagged implementation to enable automatic disabling.

The `handleError` function returns a user-friendly message that can be displayed to the user.

## Future Enhancements

-   Implement the gradual recovery system for auto-disabled flags.
-   Integrate with a dedicated error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) for centralized logging, analysis, and alerting.
-   Refine error thresholds and automatic disabling logic based on production monitoring data.
-   Implement a more robust notification system for flag state changes.
