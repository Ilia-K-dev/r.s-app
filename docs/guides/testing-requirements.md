## Overview

This document outlines the testing requirements for the Receipt Scanner application, specifying the types of testing to be performed and the expected coverage.

## Types of Testing

[Describe the different types of testing required (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, security tests, performance tests).]

## Test Coverage Goals

[Specify any goals for test coverage (e.g., percentage of code covered by unit tests).]

## Testing for New Features and Bug Fixes

[Describe the testing requirements for new features and bug fixes.]

## Testing Environment

[Reference the testing environment configuration document.]

## Security Testing Requirements

Security testing for Firebase Firestore and Storage rules is critical to ensure data protection and prevent unauthorized access. The following requirements must be met:

-   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Security rules for all Firestore collections and Storage paths must be covered by automated tests. This includes testing read, write, update, and delete operations under various authentication states (authenticated, unauthenticated) and ownership scenarios.
-   **Data Validation:** Tests must verify that data validation rules defined in `firestore.rules` are correctly enforced for all relevant fields and data types. This includes testing valid and invalid data inputs, edge cases (e.g., boundary values, empty strings, excessive lengths), and required fields.
-   **Cross-Service Validation:** For Storage rules that depend on Firestore data (e.g., inventory item images requiring a corresponding inventory document), tests must verify that these cross-service checks are correctly applied.
-   **Automated Execution:** Security tests must be integrated into the automated testing process and be runnable via a single command (`npm run test:security:automated` from the `server/` directory).
-   **Clear Reporting:** Test results should clearly indicate which rules and scenarios pass or fail to facilitate debugging and rule refinement. (Note: Advanced reporting and visualization are future considerations).

Refer to the [Firebase Testing Documentation](../firebase/testing.md) for details on running the automated security tests and setting up the testing environment.
