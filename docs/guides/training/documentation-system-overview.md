## Overview

Welcome to the training material for the Receipt Scanner application's documentation system! This document provides a high-level overview of the documentation system, its purpose, structure, and how it integrates with our development workflow.

## Purpose of the Documentation System

The primary goal of the documentation system is to provide a single, accurate, and comprehensive source of truth for all aspects of the Receipt Scanner application. This includes:

-   Onboarding new team members.
-   Understanding the application's architecture and design.
-   Detailing features, APIs, and data models.
-   Outlining development workflows and best practices.
-   Providing guides for deployment, testing, and maintenance.
-   Tracking historical decisions and changes.

By maintaining high-quality documentation, we aim to improve collaboration, reduce knowledge silos, and accelerate development.

## New Documentation Structure

The documentation has been reorganized into a logical and hierarchical structure within the `/docs/` directory. The main top-level directories include:

-   `/docs/core/`: Foundational documentation (architecture, data model, security).
-   `/docs/features/`: Documentation for user-facing features.
-   `/docs/firebase/`: Details on Firebase integration.
-   `/docs/api/`: API specifications.
-   `/docs/guides/`: How-to guides and workflows.
-   `/docs/development/`: Documentation related to the development process itself (templates, checklists).
-   `/docs/user/`: User-focused documentation (quickstarts, user guide).
-   `/docs/maintenance/`: Information for maintaining the application.
-   `/docs/archive/`: Historical and outdated documents.
-   `/docs/templates/`: Templates for creating new documentation.
-   `/docs/management/`: Reports and documents related to documentation management (inventory, quality, hierarchy).

This structure is designed to make it easier to find the information you need. You can explore the main [Receipt Scanner Documentation README](../../README.md) for a starting point and navigation. For a visual representation of the hierarchy, refer to the [Documentation Classification and Hierarchy](../../management/documentation-hierarchy.md) document.

## Key Canonical Documents

Within the new structure, certain documents are designated as "Canonical" sources of truth. These are the primary documents you should refer to for the most accurate and up-to-date information on a given topic. Examples include:

-   `/docs/core/architecture.md`
-   `/docs/core/project-structure.md`
-   `/docs/core/data-model.md`
-   `/docs/firebase/integration-architecture.md`
-   `/docs/developer/specifications/specification-api.md`
-   `/docs/guides/development-process-workflow.md`

Always prioritize information found in Canonical documents.

## Documentation Tooling

We utilize several scripts and tools to help maintain the quality and consistency of the documentation:

-   **Documentation Inventory:** `scripts/doc-inventory.js` generates a list of all markdown files.
-   **Documentation Health Metrics:** `scripts/generate-doc-health-metrics.js` provides metrics on freshness and completeness.
-   **Link Validator:** `scripts/link-validator.js` checks for broken internal links.
-   **Template Conformance Checker:** `scripts/template-conformance-checker.js` verifies adherence to templates.
-   **Code Example Validator:** `scripts/code-example-validator.js` checks code blocks.
-   **Cross-reference Validator:** `scripts/cross-reference-validator.js` checks internal link formats.
-   **Template Generator:** `scripts/generate-doc-template.js` helps create new documents from templates.

These tools help us identify and address documentation issues proactively.

## Integration with Development Workflow

Documentation is now an integral part of our development workflow. This includes:

-   **Issue Creation:** The issue template prompts consideration of documentation updates.
-   **Pull Requests:** The PR template includes a section and checklist item for documentation changes.
-   **Code Reviews:** A dedicated checklist is used to review documentation updates during code review.
-   **Release Process:** The release checklist includes a step to verify documentation completion.

By incorporating documentation into our standard processes, we ensure it stays current with code changes.
