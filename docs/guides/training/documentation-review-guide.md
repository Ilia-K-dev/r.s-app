## Overview

This guide provides instructions and tips for effectively reviewing documentation changes in pull requests.

## Purpose of Documentation Reviews

Documentation reviews are a critical step in ensuring the quality, accuracy, and consistency of our project documentation. They help to:

-   Verify that documentation accurately reflects code changes.
-   Ensure clarity and readability for the target audience.
-   Maintain consistency in structure, style, and terminology.
-   Identify any gaps or missing information.
-   Share knowledge and improve the overall understanding of the system.

## Using the Documentation Review Checklist

When reviewing documentation changes, always refer to the [Documentation Review Checklist](../../development/documentation-review-checklist.md). This checklist provides a comprehensive list of items to check, including clarity, accuracy, conformance to templates, completeness, code examples, links, and visuals. Go through each item on the checklist to ensure all aspects of the documentation have been considered.

## Focus Areas for Reviewers

In addition to the checklist, pay close attention to the following areas during a documentation review:

-   **Technical Accuracy:** Does the documentation accurately describe the code, features, or processes? Are there any technical inaccuracies or misleading statements?
-   **Clarity and Understanding:** Is the documentation easy to understand for someone who may not be familiar with the specific code or feature? Is the language clear and concise?
-   **Completeness:** Does the documentation cover all relevant aspects of the change? Is any crucial information missing?
-   **Consistency:** Does the documentation follow the established style guide and terminology? Is it consistent with related documentation?
-   **Navigation and Links:** Are internal and external links working correctly? Are there appropriate cross-references to related documents?

## Providing Constructive Feedback

When providing feedback on documentation changes, aim for constructive and actionable comments:

-   Clearly explain the issue you have identified.
-   Suggest specific changes or improvements where possible.
-   Maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
-   Remember that the goal is to improve the documentation, not just to find fault.
