## Overview

This guide provides tips and strategies for effectively finding the information you need within the Receipt Scanner application's documentation system.

## Navigating the Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into a logical structure within the `/docs/` directory. Understanding this structure is key to finding relevant information. Familiarize yourself with the main top-level directories and their contents as outlined in the [Documentation System Overview](./documentation-system-overview.md).

## Using the Main README

The main [Receipt Scanner Documentation README](../../README.md) serves as the primary entry point to the documentation. It provides a high-level overview and links to the major sections and key documents. Start here when you are looking for information.

## Exploring the Hierarchy

The [Documentation Classification and Hierarchy](../../management/documentation-hierarchy.md) document provides a visual representation of how documents are classified and related to each other. This can be helpful for understanding the relationships between different topics and finding related information.

## Utilizing Search

If you are looking for specific keywords or phrases, utilize the search functionality provided by your documentation viewer or integrated development environment (IDE). The documentation is in markdown format, which is easily searchable.

## Asking for Help

If you are unable to find the information you need, don't hesitate to ask for help from other team members. They can point you to the relevant documentation or provide clarification.
