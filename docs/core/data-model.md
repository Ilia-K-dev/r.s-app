## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive description of the data model used in the Receipt Scanner application, focusing on the structure and relationships of data stored in Cloud Firestore.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

[Include a detailed entity relationship diagram (ERD) illustrating the main data entities and their relationships. Use Mermaid.js format.]

```mermaid
%% Example Mermaid ER Diagram - Replace with actual diagram

    USER ||--o{ RECEIPT : has
    RECEIPT ||--o{ ITEM : contains
    USER ||--o{ INVENTORY_ITEM : manages
    INVENTORY_ITEM ||--o{ STOCK_MOVEMENT : tracks
    USER ||--o{ CATEGORY : defines
    RECEIPT }|--|| CATEGORY : belongs_to
    INVENTORY_ITEM }|--|| CATEGORY : belongs_to
    USER ||--o{ ALERT : receives
    INVENTORY_ITEM }|--|| ALERT : triggers
```

## Firestore Data Model Specification

#### User Document

[Describe User document fields]

#### Receipt Document

[Describe Receipt document fields]

#### Item Document (within Receipt)

[Describe Item document fields within a Receipt]

#### Inventory Item Document

[Describe Inventory Item document fields]

#### Stock Movement Document

## Field Types and Validation

[Detail the data types used for various fields and any validation rules applied on the client-side or server-side (e.g., using Firestore security rules or backend validation).]

## Indexing Strategy

[Explain the indexing strategy in Firestore to optimize query performance.]

## Example Documents

[Provide JSON examples of typical documents for key collections.]

## Relationships and Referencing

[Explain how relationships between documents are managed (e.g., using document references).]

## Future Considerations

[Planned or potential future changes to the data model.]
