# Implementation Report: Master Checklist Creation (Prompt 0)

## Summary of Changes

This report details the creation of the master project tracking checklist (`receipt-scanner-master-checklist.md`) as per Prompt 0. The checklist serves as the central document for monitoring the progress of the Receipt Scanner application development based on the defined work plan prompts.

## Files Created

*   `receipt-scanner-master-checklist.md`: The main checklist file containing all development phases and tasks derived from the prompt list.

## Checklist Structure Explanation

The `receipt-scanner-master-checklist.md` file is structured as follows:

1.  **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Provides a high-level overview of the project's status.
    *   Includes overall completion percentage, current phase focus, phase-by-phase completion percentages, and identifies the next immediate priority tasks based on the prompt sequence.

2.  **Recent Updates:**
    *   A section to log significant updates or milestones with dates (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD: Completed Prompt 1 - Backend Inventory API").

3.  **Phases:**
    *   The checklist is divided into distinct phases mirroring the development workflow outlined in the prompts (e.g., Phase 1: Backend API Implementation, Phase 2: Security Testing, etc.).

4.  **Tasks (Prompts):**
    *   Each major task corresponds to a specific prompt from the `cline prompts list and order master.txt`.
    *   Tasks are presented with a main checkbox `[ ]`.
    *   **Description:** Briefly explains the goal of the prompt/task.
    *   **Related Files:** Lists key files involved in the task.
    *   **Complexity:** Provides a rough estimate (Low/Medium/High).
    *   **Subtasks:** Breaks down the main prompt into smaller, actionable steps, each with its own checkbox `[ ]`. This allows for granular tracking within each prompt.

## How to Use the Checklist Effectively

1.  **Update Regularly:** The checklist should be updated immediately after a prompt (or significant subtask) is completed.
2.  **Mark Completion:** Check off the corresponding `[x]` boxes for completed subtasks and the main task checkbox once all subtasks are done.
3.  **Update Progress Tracking:** After completing a task, recalculate and update the "Progress Tracking" section:
    *   Update the relevant Phase Status percentage.
    *   Recalculate the Overall Completion percentage (e.g., average of phase percentages or based on task count/complexity).
    *   Update the "Current Phase" if moving to the next phase.
    *   Update "Next Priority Tasks" to reflect the next prompt in the sequence.
4.  **Log Updates:** Add an entry to the "Recent Updates" section noting the completed task and the date.
5.  **Review Dependencies:** Before starting a new task, review its description and subtasks to understand dependencies on previously completed work. The sequential nature of the prompts generally handles dependencies, but awareness is key.

## Recommended Update Frequency

The checklist should be updated **immediately upon completion of each prompt**. This ensures real-time visibility into project progress. The "Progress Tracking" and "Recent Updates" sections should be updated concurrently.

## How to Track Dependencies

*   **Sequential Prompts:** The primary mechanism for handling dependencies is the sequential order of the prompts in `cline prompts list and order master.txt`. Completing prompts in order generally ensures prerequisites are met.
*   **Task Descriptions:** Read the description of the next task carefully, as it may implicitly mention reliance on previous work (e.g., "aligning with refactored client-side service").
*   **Related Files:** The list of related files can indicate dependencies (e.g., a task modifying a controller likely depends on the controller existing).
*   **Explicit Notes (Optional):** While not explicitly required by the prompt, if complex dependencies arise, they could be noted directly within the task description or subtasks (e.g., "Depends on: Prompt 1").

This master checklist provides a clear and structured way to track the implementation progress throughout the development lifecycle of the Receipt Scanner application.
