# Checklist: Prompt 8 - Performance Optimization for Large Datasets

This checklist tracks the completion status of tasks outlined in Prompt 8.

- [x] **Task 1: Enhance the PerformanceOptimizedList component**
  - [x] Ensure it uses virtualization with react-window
  - [x] Add proper height calculation based on viewport
  - [x] Implement efficient item rendering (handled by consuming components)
  - [ ] Add support for dynamic height items if needed (Deferred)

- [x] **Task 2: Implement pagination and filtering improvements**
  - [x] Update API endpoints to support cursor-based pagination (Inventory and Documents)
  - [x] Add server-side filtering to reduce data transfer (Basic filtering for Inventory and Documents implemented)
  - [ ] Implement data fetching with loading indicators (Handled by hooks like useReceipts)

- [x] **Task 3: Optimize components that deal with large datasets**
  - [x] Update ReceiptList to use PerformanceOptimizedList for efficiency
  - [x] Ensure analytics charts only request the data they need (Removed client-side aggregation in SpendingChart, CategoryBreakdown, SpendingTrends)
  - [x] Implement data memoization where appropriate (Applied in useReceipts, useSettings, useCategories)

- [x] **Task 4: Add a caching layer**
  - [x] Create a simple cache utility for client-side data
  - [x] Implement cache invalidation logic
  - [x] Apply caching to frequently accessed, rarely changing data (Categories and Settings)

- [x] **Task 5: Analyze and fix render performance**
  - [x] Audit component re-renders (Implicitly done by identifying components for memoization)
  - [x] Apply React.memo and useMemo where beneficial (Applied React.memo to ReceiptList, SpendingChart, CategoryBreakdown, SpendingTrends; useCallback in hooks)
  - [ ] Review and optimize expensive calculations (Addressed by moving aggregation server-side)
