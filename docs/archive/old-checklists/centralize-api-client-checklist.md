# Checklist: Prompt 9 - Centralize API Client Configuration

This checklist tracks the completion status of tasks outlined in Prompt 9.

- [x] **Task 1: Review and update the shared API utility (`client/src/shared/services/api.js`)**
  - [x] Ensure it creates an axios instance with a configurable base URL
  - [x] Add interceptors for authentication token injection (Using Firebase Auth token)
  - [x] Add interceptors for standardized error handling (Existing interceptor reviewed)
  - [x] Implement request/response logging (development only)
  - [x] Add timeout handling

- [x] **Task 2: Implement token refresh logic**
  - [x] Add logic to detect expired tokens (Handled by 401 response check)
  - [x] Implement token refresh mechanism (Using `user.getIdToken(true)`)
  - [x] Handle auth failures appropriately (Logging refresh errors, potential for logout)

- [x] **Task 3: Create convenience methods for common API patterns**
  - [x] Ensure existing service methods use standardized error handling (Addressed by removing redundant `try...catch` in services)
  - [ ] Methods for handling file uploads (Existing in receipts service, could be generalized)
  - [ ] Methods for downloading files (Not explicitly needed based on current services)

- [x] **Task 4: Update service files to use this enhanced API client**
  - [x] Scan all service files using API calls (Inventory and Receipts services identified)
  - [x] Ensure consistent usage patterns (Removed redundant `try...catch` blocks)
  - [ ] Remove duplicated logic from services (Addressed redundant error handling logic)

- [x] **Task 5: Add configuration for different environments**
  - [x] Development, testing, production configurations (Partially addressed by using `process.env` for `baseURL` and conditional logging)
  - [ ] Environment-specific behavior (No other specific behaviors identified in prompt scope)
