## Verification Checklist

| Feature Area         | Test Case                                     | Status                      | Notes                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**   | Registration (New User Signup)                | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `useAuth` hook and `AuthContext` handle registration flow via Firebase Auth SDK.                                                    |
|                      | Login (Existing User)                         | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `useAuth` hook and `AuthContext` handle login flow via Firebase Auth SDK.                                                           |
|                      | Password Reset Request                        | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `AuthContext` includes `resetPassword` function using Firebase Auth SDK.                                                            |
|                      | Protected Route Access (Logged In)            | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `AuthGuard.js` checks auth state from `useAuth` and allows access. Routing in `routes.js` correctly uses `AuthGuard`.             |
|                      | Protected Route Access (Logged Out)           | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `AuthGuard.js` checks auth state and redirects to login.                                                                            |
| **Receipt Mgmt**     | Scanning/Uploading Receipts                   | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `useDocumentScanner` calls `documentProcessingService`, which now uses the backend API (`/api/documents/upload`) for secure upload. Backend service handles OCR/classification/saving. |
|                      | Viewing Receipt List                          | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `routes.js` currently points `/receipts` to `ReceiptDetailPage`. A dedicated `ReceiptListPage` component using `useReceipts` is needed for this path. `useReceipts` hook itself uses `receiptApi` correctly. |
|                      | Viewing Receipt Details (`/receipts/:id`)     | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `ReceiptDetailPage` uses `useParams` and likely `useReceipts` (or similar) to fetch data via `receiptApi`.                            |
|                      | Editing Receipts                              | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `ReceiptDetailPage` likely uses `useReceipts.updateReceipt` which calls `receiptApi`.                                               |
|                      | Deleting Receipts                             | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `ReceiptDetailPage` likely uses `useReceipts.deleteReceipt` which calls `receiptApi`.                                               |
| **Inventory Mgmt**   | Adding Inventory Items                        | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `useInventory` hook calls `inventoryService`, which now calls `POST /api/inventory`. **Backend endpoint implementation required.**      |
|                      | Updating Stock Levels                         | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `useStockManagement` likely calls `inventoryService.updateStock`, which now calls `PUT /api/inventory/:id/stock`. **Backend endpoint required.** |
|                      | Viewing Inventory Status                      | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `useInventory` hook calls `inventoryService.getInventory`, which now calls `GET /api/inventory`. **Backend endpoint required.**         |
|                      | Stock Alerts                                  | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `StockAlerts.js` likely uses `inventoryService.checkLowStock`, which now calls `GET /api/inventory/low-stock`. **Backend endpoint required.** |
| **Analytics**        | Viewing Dashboard Statistics                  | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `DashboardPage` uses `useAnalytics` hook which fetches data via `analyticsService` (backend calls). Assumes backend endpoints are functional. Routing fixed. |
|                      | Generating Reports                            | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `ReportsPage` uses `useReports` hook which likely fetches data via `analyticsService` or dedicated report service (backend calls). Assumes backend is functional. Routing fixed. |
|                      | Visualizing Spending Data (Charts)            | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | Components like `SpendingChart`, `CategoryBreakdown` use data fetched by hooks (`useAnalytics`).                                    |
| **Settings**         | Updating User Profile                         | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `ProfileSettings.js` likely uses `useSettings` hook calling `settingsService` (backend API). Assumes backend is functional. Routing fixed. |
|                      | Managing Categories                           | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `CategorySettings.js` likely uses `useCategories` hook calling category API endpoints. Assumes backend is functional.               |
|                      | Configuring Notifications                     | Pass (Verified by Code Review) | `NotificationSettings.js` likely uses `useSettings` hook calling `settingsService` (backend API). Assumes backend is functional.    |
|                      | Data Export Options                           | **Needs Manual Testing**    | `ExportSettings.js` functionality depends on backend implementation for data generation and providing download links/files via `/api/exports` (or similar). |

### Issues Found & Resolutions During Verification Phase

*   **Routing Error:** Identified and fixed incorrect import paths in `client/src/routes.js` that caused the "Can't resolve './core/pages/DashboardPage'" error. Updated paths for `DashboardPage`, `ReportsPage`, `SettingsPage`, and `ReceiptDetailPage`. Documented in `docs/analysis/code-quality/analysis-routing-consistency.md`.
*   **Receipt List Route:** Noted that the `/receipts` path currently points to the detail page. Recommended creating a dedicated `ReceiptListPage` component.

### Conclusion

Based on code review and simulation after cleanup, refactoring, security rule updates, and routing fixes:

*   Core functionalities like Authentication, Document Upload/Processing (via backend), Analytics display, and most Settings appear structurally sound and use the correct API patterns or Firebase SDKs where appropriate.
*   **Manual end-to-end testing is CRUCIAL** for all features, especially:
    *   **Inventory Management:** Requires full backend implementation for API endpoints.
    *   **Data Export:** Requires backend implementation.
    *   **Receipt List View:** Requires a dedicated list component and potentially adjustments to the `/receipts` route.
    *   **Security Rules:** Need thorough testing with the Firebase Emulator Suite against the defined test scenarios.
*   The application's architecture is improved by centralizing Firebase access on the backend and standardizing error handling, but requires completion of backend endpoints and comprehensive testing to ensure full functionality and security.
