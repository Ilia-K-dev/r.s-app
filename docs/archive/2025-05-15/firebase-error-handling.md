# Firebase Error Handling Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the standard approach for handling errors that occur during interactions with Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage) in the Receipt Scanner application. A centralized error handling utility is used to provide consistency, map Firebase error codes to user-friendly messages, and facilitate debugging through logging.

## Centralized Error Handler

All Firebase operations should utilize the `handleFirebaseError` utility function located at `client/src/utils/errorHandler.js`.

This function performs the following:

1.  **Logs the original error:** The full error object is logged to the console for detailed debugging.
2.  **Identifies Firebase Errors:** Checks if the error is an instance of `FirebaseError`.
3.  **Maps Error Codes:** If it's a `FirebaseError`, it looks up the `error.code` in a predefined map (`firebaseErrorMessages`) to find a corresponding user-friendly message.
4.  **Provides Default Messages:** If a specific mapping is not found, or if the error is not a `FirebaseError`, it provides a generic default message.
5.  **Returns User-Friendly Message:** The function returns a string containing the user-friendly error message.

## Implementation Pattern

When performing a Firebase operation within an `async` function, wrap the operation in a `try...catch` block. In the `catch` block, call `handleFirebaseError`, passing the caught error and an optional context string (e.g., the name of the function or operation). The returned user-friendly message can then be used to inform the user (e.g., via a UI notification or alert) or re-thrown for further handling up the call stack.

```javascript
import { handleFirebaseError } from '../../../utils/errorHandler';
// Import necessary Firebase functions

async function performFirebaseOperation(...) {
  try {
    // Your Firebase SDK call here
    // e.g., await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
    // e.g., await getDocs(collection(db, 'receipts'));
    // e.g., await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);

    // Return successful result
    return result;

  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error using the centralized utility
    const userFriendlyMessage = handleFirebaseError(error, 'Context of Operation');

    // Re-throw the user-friendly message or handle it as needed
    throw userFriendlyMessage;
  }
}
```

## Examples

See `client/src/features/auth/services/authService.js` for examples of how `handleFirebaseError` is integrated into authentication functions (`login`, `register`, `resetPassword`, `logout`, `updateUserProfile`).

## Adding New Error Codes

If you encounter a Firebase error code that is not currently mapped in `client/src/utils/errorHandler.js`, add a new entry to the `firebaseErrorMessages` object with a descriptive and user-friendly message.

## Logging

The `handleFirebaseError` utility automatically logs errors to the browser's console. For production environments, consider integrating with a dedicated error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics) to capture and analyze errors more effectively.

## Future Improvements

*   Integrate with a global notification system to display user-friendly messages consistently across the UI.
*   Explore more granular error contexts for logging and debugging.

## Offline Capabilities and Data Synchronization

With Firestore offline persistence enabled (`enableIndexedDbPersistence`), the application can read and write data even when there is no network connection.

### Offline Operations

*   **Reads:** When offline, Firestore reads will be served from the local cache. If the requested data is not in the cache, the read operation will fail.
*   **Writes:** When offline, write operations (add, set, update, delete) are written to a queue of pending operations stored locally.
*   **Synchronization:** When the application comes back online, Firestore automatically attempts to synchronize the pending write operations with the backend.

### Conflict Resolution

Firestore's default conflict resolution strategy is "last-write-wins". If multiple clients write to the same document offline, the last write to reach the server will be the one that is persisted.

For scenarios requiring more complex conflict resolution, custom logic would need to be implemented at the application level (e.g., using transactions or Cloud Functions). However, for the scope of this refactoring, the default behavior is acceptable.

### Connection State Monitoring

The `useFirebaseConnection` hook in `client/src/utils/connection.js` can be used to monitor the application's real-time connection status to Firebase. This hook provides a boolean value (`isConnected`) that indicates whether the application is currently connected. This can be used to:

*   Display visual indicators to the user (e.g., an "Offline" badge).
*   Adjust UI behavior based on connection status (e.g., disable buttons that require a connection).
*   Inform the user about the status of pending offline writes.

Note: The connection state monitoring relies on Firebase Realtime Database's `.info/connected` path. Ensure Realtime Database is initialized in your Firebase configuration if you plan to use this feature.
