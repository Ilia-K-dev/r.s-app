# Checklist: Implement Backend Inventory API Endpoints (Prompt 1)

This checklist tracks the completion of tasks for implementing the backend inventory API endpoints.

*   [x] Create/update `inventoryController.js` with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints for items.
    *   Added `getProductById` and `deleteProduct` functions.
*   [x] Add endpoints for stock updates (`PUT /:id/stock`).
    *   Updated route method from POST to PUT in `inventoryRoutes.js`.
*   [x] Add endpoints for stock movements (GET/POST `/movements`).
    *   Added `createStockMovement` function to `inventoryController.js`.
    *   Added POST `/movements` route to `inventoryRoutes.js`.
*   [x] Add endpoint for low stock alerts (`GET /low-stock`).
    *   Added `getLowStockAlerts` function to `inventoryController.js`.
    *   Added GET `/low-stock` route to `inventoryRoutes.js`.
*   [x] Create/update `inventoryRoutes.js` to map routes to controller functions.
    *   Updated existing routes and added new routes with `/api/inventory` base path.
*   [x] Implement authentication middleware for user data isolation.
    *   Confirmed `authenticateUser` middleware is applied to all routes in `inventoryRoutes.js`.
*   [x] Use Firebase Admin SDK for all Firestore operations.
    *   Verified that `Product.js` and `StockMovement.js` models use the Admin SDK.
*   [x] Implement standard error handling (`AppError`, consistent responses).
    *   Ensured new controller functions follow the established pattern.
*   [x] Add documentation comments (JSDoc).
    *   Added basic JSDoc comments to new controller functions.

**Completion Status:** All subtasks for Prompt 1 have been completed.
