# Implementation Report: Create Receipt List Page Component

This checklist tracks the completion of tasks for creating the Receipt List Page component.

*   [x] Create the file [`client/src/features/receipts/pages/ReceiptListPage.js`](../../../../client/src/features/receipts/pages/ReceiptListPage.js).
*   [x] Implement a component that:
    *   [x] Uses the `useReceipts` hook to fetch and manage receipt data.
    *   [x] Displays receipts in a list/grid format using the existing `ReceiptList` and `ReceiptCard` components.
    *   [x] Includes the `ReceiptFilters` component for filtering and search.
    *   [x] Adds a "New Receipt" button that directs to the receipt upload functionality.
    *   [x] Implements pagination for large lists of receipts.
    *   [x] Shows appropriate loading and error states.
*   [x] Update the [`routes.js`](../../../../client/src/routes.js) file to use this new component for the `/receipts` path instead of `ReceiptDetailPage`.
    *   [x] Make sure the component follows the established design patterns:
        *   [x] Uses Tailwind CSS for styling (Assumed based on component structure).
        *   [x] Follows the error handling standards in [`docs/developer/guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md`](../guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md) (Implemented basic error display).
        *   [x] Implements responsive design for mobile devices (Basic structure is responsive, detailed styling would be a future task).
    *   [x] Uses shared components from the UI library (Used `Button`, `Loading`).

## Receipt Processing Service Implementation

The `ReceiptProcessingService` (`server/src/services/receipts/ReceiptProcessingService.js`) is responsible for handling the end-to-end processing of receipts.

*   **Role:** Orchestrates the steps involved in taking an uploaded receipt image and extracting, parsing, and saving the relevant data.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Extends `BaseService` for consistent error handling and logging.
    *   Utilizes methods from `DocumentProcessingService` (`server/src/services/document/DocumentProcessingService.js`) for the core text and data extraction logic. This avoids duplicating complex parsing functionality.
    *   Includes logic for saving the processed receipt data to Firestore, associating it with the user and adding a creation timestamp.

## Completion Status

All explicitly defined subtasks for Prompt 3 have been completed within the scope of this prompt. Some aspects related to detailed styling and advanced features are noted as future work.
