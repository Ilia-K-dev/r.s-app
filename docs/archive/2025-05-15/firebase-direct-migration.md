# Firebase Direct Integration Migration Log

This document tracks the architectural changes made during the refactoring of the Receipt Scanner application to use Firebase SDKs directly, eliminating the dependency on the Express backend.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication

**Completed Tasks:**

-   **Firebase Configuration Review:** Reviewed `client/src/core/config/firebase.js`. Confirmed Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Storage are initialized and modular imports are used. Noted hardcoded configuration needs to be replaced with environment variables for production.
-   **Authentication Service Migration:** Reviewed `client/src/features/auth/services/authService.js` and `client/src/core/contexts/AuthContext.js`. Confirmed they were already using Firebase Auth SDK directly. No code modifications were required for migration, but error handling was updated in Task 1.4.
-   **Firebase Security Rules Foundations:** Reviewed `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules`. Updated `firestore.rules` for more explicit receipt-specific validation and user ownership checks. Confirmed `storage.rules` for receipts and profiles already had appropriate user ownership, size, and type restrictions.
-   **Error Handling Strategy:** Created `client/src/utils/errorHandler.js` for centralized Firebase error handling. Updated `client/src/features/auth/services/authService.js` to use the new error handler. Documented the error handling approach in `docs/developer/guides/firebase-error-handling.md`.
-   **Offline Capability Configuration:** Enabled Firestore offline persistence in `client/src/core/config/firebase.js`. Created `client/src/utils/connection.js` for connection state monitoring. Documented the offline strategy and conflict resolution in `docs/developer/guides/firebase-error-handling.md`.

## Phase 2: Receipt Management Refactoring

**In Progress Tasks:**

-   **Receipt Service Migration (Task 2.1):** Refactored `client/src/features/receipts/services/receipts.js` to replace API calls with direct Firebase Firestore and Storage operations (get, getById, create, update, delete, correct).
-   **Receipt Upload Migration (Task 2.2):** Integrated client-side OCR using Tesseract.js (`client/src/features/receipts/services/receiptOcrService.js`) into the document processing hook (`client/src/features/documents/hooks/useDocumentScanner.js`). Modified the upload flow to perform OCR client-side and then use the refactored `receiptApi.createReceipt` to upload to Storage and save to Firestore.

**Related Configuration Changes:**

-   **Babel Configuration (`babel.config.js`):** Added `cwd: 'babelrc'` option to the `module-resolver` plugin configuration to potentially fix module resolution issues when running tests in subdirectories.
-   **Jest Configuration (`server/package.json`):** Added `moduleNameMapper` configuration to the `jest` field to potentially help resolve `babel-plugin-module-resolver` for server tests.

**Security Rules Test Suite:**

-   Created a comprehensive test suite for Firebase security rules using `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`.
-   Created `server/tests/security/firestore.test.js` with tests for authentication, users, and receipts collections.
-   Created `server/tests/security/storage.test.js` with tests for authentication, receipts, and profile images paths, including size and type restrictions.
-   Encountered and attempted to fix issues with file paths and outdated API usage in the test files.
-   Currently facing a "Cannot find module 'babel-plugin-module-resolver'" error when running tests, which is blocking validation. Requires human assistance to debug and fix the test environment setup.

## Next Steps

1.  **Resolve Test Environment Issue:** Debug and fix the "Cannot find module 'babel-plugin-module-resolver'" error in the server test environment with human assistance.
2.  **Validate Security Rules:** Run the comprehensive security rules test suite to ensure all rules pass.
3.  **Complete Phase 2:** Continue with remaining tasks in Phase 2 (Receipt Security Rules testing - blocked, Feature Toggle Implementation).
4.  **Proceed with Work Plan:** Move through subsequent phases (Document Processing, Inventory Management, Analytics, Final Testing & Documentation) as outlined in the work plan.
