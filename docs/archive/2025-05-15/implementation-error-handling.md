# Implementation Report: Update Error Handling Implementation (Prompt 7)

## Summary of Changes

This report details the updates made to the application's error handling implementation as per Prompt 7. The goal was to ensure consistent error handling across client and server based on the defined standards in [`docs/developer/guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md`](../../../guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md).

## Files Created

*   [`client/src/shared/utils/errorHandler.js`](../../../../client/src/shared/utils/errorHandler.js): New utility file for centralized client-side error handling.

## Files Modified

*   [`client/src/shared/services/api.js`](../../../../client/src/shared/services/api.js): Added a response interceptor to consistently handle API errors and extract user-friendly messages. Updated individual API functions to use `try...catch` and rethrow errors.
*   [`client/src/features/receipts/hooks/useReceipts.js`](../../../../client/src/features/receipts/hooks/useReceipts.js): Updated the hook to use the `errorHandler.js` utility for handling errors in data fetching and mutations.
*   [`client/src/features/inventory/hooks/useInventory.js`](../../../../client/src/features/inventory/hooks/useInventory.js): Updated the hook to use the `errorHandler.js` utility for handling errors.
*   [`client/src/features/analytics/hooks/useAnalytics.js`](../../../../client/src/features/analytics/hooks/useAnalytics.js): Updated the hook to use the `errorHandler.js` utility for handling errors during analytics data fetching.
*   [`client/src/features/settings/hooks/useSettings.js`](../../../../client/src/features/settings/hooks/useSettings.js): Updated the hook to use the `errorHandler.js` utility for handling errors in settings operations.
*   [`client/src/features/receipts/components/ReceiptForm.js`](../../../../client/src/features/receipts/components/ReceiptForm.js): Updated the component to accept an `error` prop and display it using the `Alert` component. Ensured the `loading` prop is used to disable the submit button.

## Key Implementation Decisions and Reasoning

*   **Centralized Client-Side Error Handling:** Created `errorHandler.js` to provide a single function for handling errors on the client. This promotes consistency in logging, user notification (via toast), and extracting user-friendly messages.
*   **API Interceptor:** Implemented a response interceptor in `api.js` to catch errors from API calls, extract the relevant message from the server response, and rethrow a new `Error` object with this message. This ensures that hooks and components receive consistent error objects.
*   **Hook Updates:** Modified various hooks to call the `errorHandler` utility within their `catch` blocks. This replaces scattered error handling logic with a centralized approach, making the hooks cleaner and more maintainable. The hooks continue to set their local `error` state with the user-friendly message returned by `errorHandler`.
*   **Component Error Display:** Verified that components like [`InventoryList.js`](../../../../client/src/features/inventory/components/InventoryList.js) already use the `error` state to display alerts. Updated [`ReceiptForm.js`](../../../../client/src/features/receipts/components/ReceiptForm.js) to accept and display an `error` prop, ensuring that errors from the hook are visible to the user. Ensured components utilize the `loading` state to provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations.
*   **Adherence to Standards:** The changes align with the principles outlined in [`docs/developer/guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md`](../../../guides/guide-error-handling-standards.md), promoting consistency in error reporting and handling across the application layers.

## Potential Improvements for Future Iterations

*   **More Granular Error Types:** Define more specific client-side error types (e.g., `NetworkError`, `ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`) to allow for more tailored handling and user feedback in hooks and components.
*   **Automated Error Reporting:** Integrate an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag) and configure the `errorHandler` utility to report errors to the service for better tracking and debugging in production.
*   **User-Friendly Error Messages Mapping:** Implement a mapping in `errorHandler.js` to translate technical error messages from the server or external APIs into more user-friendly language.
*   **Retry Mechanisms:** For certain types of transient errors (e.g., network issues), consider implementing automated retry mechanisms within the API service or hooks.

## Challenges Encountered and How They Were Resolved

*   **Integrating `errorHandler` into Hooks:** Ensuring that the `errorHandler` utility was correctly integrated into the existing `try...catch...finally` structure of various hooks required careful modification of each hook's error handling logic.
*   **Component Error Propagations:** Confirming that error states were correctly propagated from hooks to components and displayed appropriately required examining several component files and adding/updating error display logic where necessary.

This implementation report documents the updates made to the error handling implementation as part of Prompt 7, contributing to a more robust and user-friendly application.
