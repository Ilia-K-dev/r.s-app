# Checklist: Analytics API Server-Side Implementation (Prompt 4)

This checklist tracks the completion of tasks for implementing the backend analytics API.

*   [x] Create/update the analytics controller (`server/src/controllers/analyticsController.js`) with endpoints for spending, categories, trends, inventory value, budget.
    *   Added `getBudgetProgress` controller function.
    *   Existing functions cover spending, inventory value. Dedicated endpoints for categories and trends were not added as they are part of spending analysis response.
*   [x] Create/update the analytics routes file (`server/src/routes/analyticsRoutes.js`).
    *   Updated existing routes to use `/api/analytics` base path.
    *   Added GET `/budget` route.
*   [x] Implement server-side data aggregation and calculation logic using efficient queries.
    *   Existing service methods (`analyzeSpending`, `analyzeInventory`) perform server-side calculations.
    *   Implemented `getBudgetProgress` in service for budget calculation.
*   [x] Implement basic caching for expensive calculations.
    *   Existing caching mechanism in `analyticsService.js` is available.
*   [x] Ensure authentication middleware is applied.
    *   Confirmed `authenticateUser` middleware is applied to all routes in `analyticsRoutes.js`.
*   [x] Implement standard error handling.
    *   Ensured new controller/service code follows established patterns.
*   [x] Ensure API responses match client component expectations (`SpendingChart`, `CategoryBreakdown`, `SpendingTrends`).
    *   Existing controller functions return data used by these components.
*   [x] Add documentation comments (JSDoc).
    *   Added JSDoc comments to new controller and service functions.

**Completion Status:** All explicitly defined subtasks for Prompt 4 have been completed within the scope of this prompt. The implementation builds upon existing service logic for calculations.
