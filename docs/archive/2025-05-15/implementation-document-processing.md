### Summary of Changes

This report details the enhancements and refactoring made to the backend document processing API. The focus was on improving OCR accuracy and parsing, adding a receipt correction endpoint, implementing more comprehensive error handling, and improving the service architecture.

### Files Modified

*   [`server/src/controllers/documentController.js`](../../../../server/src/controllers/documentController.js): Added the `correctReceipt` controller function to handle requests for saving corrected receipt data.
*   [`server/src/routes/documentRoutes.js`](../../../../server/src/routes/documentRoutes.js): Added a new PUT route `/correct/:id` mapped to the `correctReceipt` controller function.
*   [`server/src/services/document/DocumentProcessingService.js`](../../../../server/src/services/document/DocumentProcessingService.js):
    *   Refactored to extend `BaseService` for standardized error handling and logging.
    *   Updated error handling within methods to use `this.handleError`.
    *   Removed local imports for `logger` and `AppError`.
    *   Updated the `metadataPatterns` object with improved regex for extracting date and total from receipts.
    *   Updated the `_extractMetadata` helper function to include confidence scores for extracted fields and prioritize matches found within text blocks.
    *   Enhanced error handling in `extractTextFromGcsUri` and `classifyDocumentText` to provide more specific error messages and ensure detailed logging.
*   [`server/src/services/orchestration/DocumentProcessingOrchestrator.js`](../../../../server/src/services/orchestration/DocumentProcessingOrchestrator.js):
    *   Created to orchestrate the document processing steps.
    *   Calls methods from `DocumentProcessingService` to perform image optimization, text extraction, and classification.
    *   Extends `BaseService` for standardized error handling.
    *   Removed placeholder service instantiations and methods.
*   [`server/src/services/receipts/ReceiptProcessingService.js`](../../../../server/src/services/receipts/ReceiptProcessingService.js):
    *   Refactored to extend `BaseService`.
    *   Updated `processReceipt` to utilize methods from `DocumentProcessingService` for text and data extraction.
    *   Removed placeholder service instantiations and extraction methods.

### Key Implementation Decisions and Reasoning

*   **Service Inheritance:** Implemented inheritance from `BaseService` in `DocumentProcessingService`, `DocumentProcessingOrchestrator`, and `ReceiptProcessingService` to centralize error handling and logging, promoting code reusability and consistency.
*   **Orchestrator Pattern:** Introduced `DocumentProcessingOrchestrator` to manage the sequence of document processing steps, separating the orchestration logic from the individual service implementations. This improves modularity and maintainability.
*   **Receipt Correction Endpoint:** A dedicated `PUT /correct/:id` endpoint was added to allow clients to submit corrected data for a specific document. Using PUT is appropriate as it represents an update to an existing resource.
*   **Storing Original OCR vs. Corrected Data:** The `saveCorrection` function is designed to store the user-provided `correctedData` separately while retaining the `originalOcrResult`. This allows for auditing and potential future improvements to the OCR model based on user corrections.
*   **Improved Metadata Extraction:** The `metadataPatterns` and `_extractMetadata` function were updated to use more robust regex patterns for common receipt fields like date and total. Prioritizing matches within text blocks (`confidence = 0.8`) over full text matches (`confidence = 0.4`) is a heuristic to improve accuracy, assuming key information is often structured in blocks.
*   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Error handling in the service functions was refined to provide more specific `AppError` messages, including details about whether the failure originated from the Vision API or during text classification/parsing. This helps the client and developers diagnose issues more effectively. Detailed logging with stack traces is maintained for server-side debugging.
*   **Receipt-Specific Processing:** Updated `ReceiptProcessingService` to leverage the comprehensive extraction capabilities within `DocumentProcessingService`, avoiding duplication of complex parsing logic.

### Potential Improvements for Future Iterations

*   **More Advanced OCR Parsing:** The current regex-based parsing is limited. Implementing more sophisticated techniques, potentially involving machine learning or analyzing the spatial relationships between text blocks, could significantly improve accuracy across diverse receipt formats.
*   **Itemized List Extraction:** Extracting individual line items from receipts is a complex task not fully addressed in this prompt. This would require dedicated logic to identify patterns of item descriptions, quantities, and prices within the text blocks.
*   **Confidence Score Refinement:** The current confidence scores are simple heuristics. More advanced methods could be developed to provide more accurate confidence levels for extracted fields.
*   **Automated Retries:** For transient Vision API errors, implementing automated retry logic within `extractTextFromGcsUri` could improve the success rate without requiring client intervention.
*   **Dedicated Data Extraction Services:** Consider creating dedicated data extraction services (e.g., `ReceiptDataExtractor`, `InvoiceDataExtractor`) to further separate data extraction logic from the core document processing steps, improving modularity and testability.

### Challenges Encountered and How They Were Resolved

*   **`replace_in_file` Mismatches:** Encountered issues with `replace_in_file` due to subtle differences between the expected file content and the actual content, likely caused by auto-formatting or previous edits. This was resolved by carefully reviewing the provided `file_content` in the error messages and using smaller, more precise `SEARCH` blocks, and ultimately resorting to a `write_to_file` for a larger section when multiple `replace_in_file` attempts failed.
*   **File Path Inconsistencies:** Experienced issues with file not found errors when attempting to read files that were listed in the environment details. This required using the `list_files` tool to confirm the correct file names and paths within the current working directory.

This implementation report documents the enhancements and refactoring made to the document processing API, providing context for future development and potential areas for further improvement.
