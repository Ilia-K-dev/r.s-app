## Overview
The Receipt Scanner application has been updated with a new underlying technology for managing your data. We've integrated directly with Firebase, a powerful platform that helps us improve the application's performance and reliability, especially when you're offline.

While you might not see major changes to the look and feel of the app immediately, these updates bring significant improvements to how your data is handled and synchronized.

## Explanation of User-Visible Changes
For most users, the primary changes will be improvements in the application's responsiveness and reliability. Data operations, such as saving a new receipt or viewing your inventory, may feel faster due to direct communication with the data storage.

There are no significant changes to the user interface or core workflows as a direct result of this integration, but the underlying data management is now more robust.

## New Features or Capabilities
The most notable new capability enabled by this integration is enhanced **offline support**. The application can now cache your data locally, allowing you to continue using key features even when you don't have an internet connection.

## Changed Behaviors
With the new offline support, you might notice that the application remains functional even when you are disconnected. Changes you make while offline will be stored locally and automatically synchronized with your account when you regain internet access.

You may see indicators within the app (depending on future UI updates) that show the synchronization status.

## Offline Capabilities Explanation
The application now utilizes a local cache to store your data. This means you can:

- **View Existing Data:** Access receipts, inventory items, and other data that you have previously viewed while online.
- **Make Changes:** Add new receipts, update inventory quantities, or make other modifications to your data. These changes will be saved locally.

When your device reconnects to the internet, the application will automatically synchronize your local changes with your online account. If there are conflicts (e.g., the same data was changed online and offline), the application will handle them, typically by prioritizing the most recent change.

## Troubleshooting Guidance
If you encounter issues related to data synchronization or access after using the app offline:

- **Check your internet connection:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection for synchronization to occur.
- **Restart the application:** Sometimes, simply closing and reopening the app can help trigger synchronization.
- **Check for synchronization indicators:** Look for any in-app messages or icons that indicate synchronization status or errors.
- **Contact Support:** If issues persist, please contact support with details about the problem and whether you were using the app offline.

## Considerations
### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Will my data be safe with this new update?**
A: Yes, your data is secured using Firebase's robust security features and rules, ensuring that only you can access and modify your information.

**Q: What happens if I make changes offline and then connect to a different device?**
A: Once your device with offline changes reconnects and synchronizes, the updated data will be available on all your devices when they are online and synchronized.

**Q: Does this change how I log in?**
A: The login process remains the same, utilizing Firebase Authentication for secure access to your account.
