## Overview

This quickstart guide is for developers who will be implementing new features or making changes to existing functionality in the Receipt Scanner application. It will help you understand the key aspects of the codebase and the development process relevant to feature development.

## Understanding the Development Workflow

Before you start coding, familiarize yourself with the project's development workflow. This includes how tasks are initiated, the branching strategy, and the steps from local development to deployment.

Refer to the [Development Process Workflow Guide](../guides/development-process-workflow.md) for a detailed explanation of the development process.

## Working with the API

The frontend application interacts with the backend server through a well-defined API. As a feature developer, you will often need to make API calls to fetch or manipulate data.

The [Backend API Specification](../developer/specifications/specification-api.md) provides comprehensive documentation of all available API endpoints, including their descriptions, required parameters, request/response formats, and authentication requirements. Use this document as your primary reference when working with the API.

The client-side API service is typically handled by a centralized module (e.g., `client/src/shared/services/api.js`). Feature-specific API calls are often encapsulated within service files within each feature module (e.g., `client/src/features/receipts/services/receipts.js`).

## Understanding Data Models

Understanding the structure of the data is crucial for feature development. The application uses Firebase Firestore as its primary database.

The [Receipt Scanner Application Data Model](../core/data-model.md) document describes the structure of the data stored in Firestore, including the different collections, document fields, and relationships between them. Refer to this document to understand how data is organized and what fields are available for each data type (receipts, inventory items, users, etc.).

## Using UI Components

The application uses a system of reusable UI components to ensure consistency in the user interface. When building new features, you should leverage these existing components whenever possible.

The [UI Component Usage Guide](../developer/guides/guide-ui-component-usage.md) provides documentation on the available UI components, their props, and how to use them correctly. This guide will help you build new interfaces quickly and maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Implementing New Features

When implementing a new feature, follow these general steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements:** Clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of the feature.
2. **Design the Implementation:** Plan how the feature will be implemented, considering both frontend and backend changes (if necessary). Identify which API endpoints you will need to use or create, and how the data will be modeled and stored.
3. **Implement the Frontend:** Build the user interface using existing UI components and implement the necessary logic to interact with the API and manage state.
4. **Implement the Backend (if necessary):** Create new API endpoints or modify existing ones to support the feature's functionality. Implement the business logic in the relevant service files.
5. **Write Tests:** Write unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests to verify the correctness and functionality of your feature.
6. **Document Your Changes:** Update the relevant documentation to reflect your new feature, including API documentation, data model updates, and any changes to workflows or guides.

## Testing Your Features

Thorough testing is essential to ensure the quality and stability of your features.

Refer to the [Testing Requirements Guide](../guides/testing-requirements.md) for an overview of the different types of testing required in the project. Implement tests that cover the core functionality, edge cases, and error handling of your feature.
