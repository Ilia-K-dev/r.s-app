## Overview

This quickstart guide is for developers and team members responsible for maintaining the Receipt Scanner application. It provides a starting point for understanding the application's architecture, deployment process, testing strategies, and how to approach maintenance tasks.

## Understanding the Application Architecture

A solid understanding of the application's architecture is essential for effective maintenance. This includes knowing how the different components (frontend, backend, Firebase Functions) interact and how data flows through the system.

Refer to the [Application Architecture Overview](../developer/architecture/architecture-overview.md) for a high-level view of the system and its core features. For more detailed architectural aspects, explore the documents in the `docs/developer/architecture/` directory, such as the [API Integration Map](../developer/architecture/architecture-api-integration-map.md) and [Database Schema Analysis](../developer/architecture/architecture-database-schema-analysis.md).

## Managing Deployments

Maintainers are responsible for deploying new versions of the application to different environments, including production.

The [Production Deployment Process Guide](../guides/deployment-process.md) outlines the steps and prerequisites for deploying the application. Familiarize yourself with this process to ensure smooth and reliable deployments.

## Ensuring Application Quality (Testing)

Maintaining application quality involves understanding and utilizing the project's testing strategies.

The [Testing Requirements Guide](../guides/testing-requirements.md) specifies the different types of testing performed in the project (unit, integration, security, performance, etc.). The `docs/testing/` directory contains more detailed documentation on specific testing aspects, such as [Firebase Testing Documentation](../firebase/testing.md) and [Firebase Direct Integration Test Automation Setup](../testing/firebase-integration-test-automation.md).

## Troubleshooting and Error Handling

When issues arise, maintainers need to be able to effectively troubleshoot and understand how errors are handled in the application.

The [Error Handling Guide](../guides/error-handling.md) describes the application's error handling standards and implementation on both the client and server sides. This document will help you understand how errors are logged and how to approach debugging.

## Addressing Technical Debt and Recommendations

The project has undergone analysis to identify areas for improvement and potential technical debt.

The [Improvement Recommendations Document](../maintenance/maintenance-recommendations.md) summarizes the key recommendations based on the comprehensive analysis. As a maintainer, you will be responsible for prioritizing and addressing these recommendations to improve the application's maintainability, performance, and security.
