# Maintenance Recommendations

This document outlines recommendations for maintaining the Receipt Scanner application to ensure its long-term health, stability, and maintainability.

## Code Quality and Standards

-   Adhere to established coding standards and style guides (e.g., ESLint, Prettier configurations).
-   Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential issues and ensure consistency.
-   Refactor complex or duplicated code to improve readability and reduce technical debt.
-   Ensure adequate test coverage for all critical components and features.

## Dependency Management

-   Regularly update project dependencies to incorporate security patches and new features.
-   Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) and keep dependency lists clean.
-   Be cautious when introducing new dependencies and evaluate their impact and maintenance burden.

## Documentation

-   Keep all documentation up-to-date with the current state of the codebase.
-   Document complex logic, architectural decisions, and external integrations.
-   Maintain comprehensive README files for each service and the monorepo root.
-   Ensure API documentation is accurate and reflects the current endpoints and data structures.

## Monitoring and Alerting

-   Implement comprehensive application monitoring for performance, errors, and key metrics.
-   Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, or security incidents.
-   Regularly review logs and monitoring dashboards to proactively identify issues.

## Error Tracking and Logging

-   Utilize a centralized error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to capture and analyze application errors.
-   Implement consistent logging practices across frontend and backend components.
-   Ensure logs include sufficient context (user ID, request details, feature flag states) to aid debugging.

## Security

-   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
-   Keep dependencies updated to address known vulnerabilities.
-   Follow secure coding practices and protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
-   Regularly review and update Firebase security rules.

## Performance Optimization

-   Monitor application performance using tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or browser developer tools.
-   Identify and address performance bottlenecks in both frontend and backend code.
-   Optimize database queries and minimize unnecessary data fetching.
-   Implement caching strategies where appropriate.

## Database Management

-   Regularly back up production databases.
-   Monitor database performance and optimize slow queries.
-   Plan and execute database schema changes carefully.

## Build and Deployment

-   Automate build and deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines.
-   Implement blue/green deployments or canary releases for safer rollouts.
-   Ensure rollback procedures are well-defined and tested.

## Feature Flag Management

-   **Purpose:** Feature flags are used for safe rollout, emergency fallback, A/B testing, and controlled migration.
-   **Management:** Feature flags can be managed via the Admin UI component (`client/src/features/settings/components/FeatureToggles.js`).
-   **Guidelines:**
    -   Use clear and descriptive names for feature flags.
    -   Document the purpose and impact of each flag in the code and documentation.
    -   Define ownership for each feature flag.
    -   Avoid accumulating unused or "stale" feature flags; plan for their eventual removal.
    -   Be aware of the potential performance impact of feature flag checks in critical paths.
    -   Monitor error rates and performance metrics for features controlled by flags.
    -   Utilize the automatic disabling system and consider implementing gradual recovery.
    -   Restrict access to feature flag management tools to authorized personnel.
-   **Auditing:** Changes to feature flags are audited with timestamps and user information (where available). Review audit logs to understand flag state changes.

## Technical Debt

-   Regularly assess and document technical debt.
-   Allocate time in sprints to address high-priority technical debt.
-   Prioritize technical debt that impacts maintainability, performance, or security.

## Disaster Recovery

-   Develop and test a disaster recovery plan.
-   Ensure backups are restorable and stored securely offsite.
-   Document procedures for restoring services in case of an outage.
