## 1. Environment Configuration Status

The application relies on environment variables for both client and server configurations. Templates (`.env.template`) are provided, but actual values must be configured in the deployment environment.

### Client-Side Environment Variables

*   **Required Variables:**
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
    *   `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
    *   `REACT_APP_API_URL` (Base URL for backend API, e.g., `/api` for Firebase Hosting or a full URL)
*   **Current Status:** Configured in `client/.env.development` for local development. Validation logic exists in `client/src/core/config/firebase.js` to check for presence at startup.
*   **Location for Production:** These variables must be configured in the **hosting platform's environment settings** (e.g., Firebase Hosting environment variables, Netlify build settings, Vercel environment variables). They are typically injected into the client build process.
*   **Human Action Required:**
    1.  Create a production `.env` file (e.g., `.env.production`) based on `client/.env.template` with actual production Firebase project credentials.
    2.  Configure these variables in the chosen client hosting platform's environment settings.

### Server-Side Environment Variables

*   **Required Variables:**
    *   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (Path to the Firebase Admin SDK service account key file)
    *   `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` (Used by Firebase Admin SDK)
    *   `PORT` (Port for the Express server, typically handled by hosting platform)
    *   `NODE_ENV` (Set to 'production')
*   **Current Status:** Configured in `server/.env` for local development. Startup validation exists in `server/src/scripts/checkEnv.js`.
*   **Location for Production:**
    *   `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: The service account key file should be stored securely and the environment variable should point to its location in the deployment environment. **Avoid committing this file to version control.**
    *   `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Configured in the hosting platform's environment settings.
    *   `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`: Typically set automatically by the hosting platform.
*   **Human Action Required:**
    1.  Create a production `.env` file based on `server/.env.template` with actual production Firebase project credentials and service account path.
    2.  **Securely store the Firebase Admin SDK service account key file** in the production environment (e.g., using Google Secret Manager, encrypted environment variables, or a secure file location accessible by the server).
    3.  Configure `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and potentially `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path in the chosen server hosting platform's environment settings.

## 2. API Keys and External Service Dependencies

*   **Google Cloud Vision API:**
    *   **Status:** Integrated on the server-side (`server/src/services/document/documentService.js`) using the `@google-cloud/vision` library. Relies on `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for authentication.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Ensure the service account used for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` has the necessary **permissions** to access the Google Cloud Vision API (`roles/cloudvision.user`).
*   **Firebase Project Configuration:**
    *   **Status:** Client and server are configured to connect to a Firebase project using environment variables (`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_...`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`).
    *   **Human Action Required:** A dedicated **production Firebase project** should be set up. The credentials in the production environment variables must point to this production project.
*   **Firebase Admin SDK Service Account:**
    *   **Status:** Used on the server for secure Firestore and Storage operations (`server/config/firebase.js`). Relies on `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.
    *   **Human Action Required:** A service account key must be generated for the production Firebase project. This key file is critical and must be stored securely (see Environment Configuration Status). The service account needs appropriate **IAM roles** in the production Firebase project (e.g., `roles/datastore.user`, `roles/storage.admin`).
*   **Other External Service Dependencies:** None explicitly identified as critical for core functionality beyond Firebase and Google Cloud Vision.

## 3. Deployment Prerequisites

*   **Hosting/Deployment Strategy:** The project structure (`client/build` for hosting, `functions/` for Cloud Functions, `server/` for backend API) suggests deployment to **Firebase Hosting** (for the client static files) and **Firebase Cloud Functions** (for the backend API and potential background tasks).
*   **Firebase Project Production Readiness:**
    *   **Status:** Development setup is functional.
    *   **Human Action Required:**
        1.  Set up a dedicated **production Firebase project**.
        2.  Enable required Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions) in the production project.
        3.  Configure Authentication methods (Email/Password, Google, etc.).
        4.  Deploy Firestore and Storage security rules (`firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`) to the production project.
        5.  Deploy Firestore indexes (`firestore.indexes.json`) to the production project.
*   **Domain Configuration:**
    *   **Status:** Not configured in the codebase.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Configure a custom domain for Firebase Hosting if needed. Update `REACT_APP_API_URL` on the client if the backend API is not served from the same domain (e.g., if using separate Cloud Functions URLs).
*   **SSL Certificate Status:**
    *   **Status:** Typically handled automatically by Firebase Hosting.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Verify SSL is enabled and working correctly after domain configuration.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Status:**
    *   **Status:** Not implemented in the provided codebase.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Cloud Build) to automate building, testing, and deploying the client, server, and functions to the production Firebase project.

## 4. Data Migration Requirements

*   **Data Migration:**
    *   **Status:** No automated data migration scripts are included.
    *   **Human Action Required:** If existing data from development needs to be transferred to production, a manual or scripted data export/import process will be required for Firestore and potentially Storage.
*   **Schema Changes:**
    *   **Status:** The Firestore schema is defined implicitly by the models and security rules. No explicit schema migration scripts are present.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Review the current data models and Firestore indexes (`firestore.indexes.json`) to ensure they are suitable for production scale and queries. Any schema changes between versions will require manual migration steps.
*   **Initial Data Seeding:**
    *   **Status:** No initial data seeding scripts are included.
    *   **Human Action Required:** If the application requires initial data (e.g., default categories, admin users), scripts or manual steps will be needed to populate the production database.

## 5. Security Verification Status

*   **Security Rules Testing:**
    *   **Status:** Testing scripts (`server/tests/security/`) are implemented using the Firebase Emulator Suite (Prompt 6).
    *   **Human Action Required:** **Run these tests against the Firebase Emulator Suite** to verify the deployed security rules enforce the intended access controls. Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Outstanding Security Concerns:**
    *   **Status:** Identified in `docs/maintenance/maintenance-technical-debt.md`. Includes:
        *   Direct Firebase access from client (largely addressed by moving to API calls, but review remaining instances).
        *   Incomplete security rules (addressed in Prompt 6, but testing is crucial).
        *   Secrets management (`.env` files are not encrypted, service account key file security is manual).
    *   **Human Action Required:** Address remaining direct client Firebase access instances. Implement a secure secrets management solution for production credentials.
*   **Authentication Flow Verification:**
    *   **Status:** Authentication flow (login, registration, logout, protected routes) verified via code review (Functionality Verification Report).
    *   **Human Action Required:** **Perform manual end-to-end testing** of the authentication flow in the deployed production environment. Consider enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Firebase Auth settings.
*   **Recommended Security Audits:**
    *   **Human Action Required:** Conduct a security audit of the deployed application, including penetration testing and code review, before a full production launch. Review Firebase Auth settings, database access controls, and Cloud Function permissions.

## 6. Performance Verification Status

*   **Areas Requiring Performance Testing:**
    *   **Status:** Identified in Prompt 8 report and `technical-debt.md`. Includes:
        *   Fetching and rendering large lists (Receipts, Inventory).
        *   Analytics data aggregation and chart rendering.
        *   Export generation for large datasets.
        *   Firestore query performance with increasing data volume.
*   **Identified Performance Bottlenecks:**
    *   **Status:** Initial bottlenecks related to client-side data aggregation and lack of pagination were addressed in Prompt 8. Firestore limitations for complex filtering (e.g., stock levels) were noted.
    *   **Human Action Required:** **Conduct performance testing** in a production-like environment with realistic data volumes. Monitor Firestore query performance and optimize indexes or queries as needed.
*   **Load Testing Requirements:**
    *   **Status:** Not performed.
    *   **Human Action Required:** Conduct load testing on the backend API and Cloud Functions to ensure they can handle expected user traffic and data processing loads in production.

This report provides a detailed overview of the current deployment readiness. Completing the highlighted human actions and recommended testing/audits is essential before the application is fully production-ready.
