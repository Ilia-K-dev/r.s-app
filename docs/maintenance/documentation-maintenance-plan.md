## Overview

This document outlines the plan for ongoing maintenance of the Receipt Scanner application's documentation to ensure its continued accuracy, relevance, and quality.

## Ongoing Activities

A regular schedule of activities is essential for effective documentation maintenance.

### Weekly Documentation Review

-   **Frequency:** Weekly
-   **Activity:** Review recent documentation updates included in merged pull requests. Address any immediate issues or questions raised during code review that were not fully resolved.
-   **Responsible:** Development Team

### Monthly Documentation Health Check

-   **Frequency:** Monthly
-   **Activity:** Run documentation validation scripts (`link-validator.js`, `template-conformance-checker.js`, `code-example-validator.js`, `cross-reference-validator.js`). Review the [Documentation Health Metrics Report](../../docs/management/documentation-health-metrics.md) to identify trends in freshness and completeness. Prioritize and create issues for addressing any identified documentation issues (broken links, conformance issues, etc.).
-   **Responsible:** Designated Documentation Owner or rotating team member

### Quarterly Documentation Overhaul

-   **Frequency:** Quarterly
-   **Activity:** Conduct a more in-depth review of a specific section of the documentation or a cross-cutting theme (e.g., security documentation, a major feature's documentation). Update content based on recent code changes, refactor for clarity, and ensure consistency. Review and update the documentation consolidation plan as needed.
-   **Responsible:** Development Team (potentially a dedicated effort for a short period)
