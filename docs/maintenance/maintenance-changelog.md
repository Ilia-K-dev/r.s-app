# Project Cleanup and Documentation Changelog (2025-04-29)

This document summarizes the changes made to the Receipt Scanner project during the recent session.

## Table of Contents

*   [I. Validation Logic Consolidation](#i-validation-logic-consolidation)
*   [II. File Organization (Moves to `/extra`)](#ii-file-organization-moves-to-extra)
*   [III. Documentation Generation](#iii-documentation-generation)

## I. Validation Logic Consolidation

The primary goal was to consolidate duplicated validation logic, particularly for file validation, into shared utility modules.

1.  **Shared Validation Utilities ([`client/src/shared/utils/validation.js`](../../../client/src/shared/utils/validation.js)):**
    *   **Action:** Moved `validateEmail`, `validatePassword`, `validateAmount`, and `validateRequired` functions from [`client/src/features/receipts/utils/validation.js`](../../../client/src/features/receipts/utils/validation.js) into this shared file.
    *   **Reason:** To centralize common input validation logic for reuse across different features.

2.  **Shared File Helpers ([`client/src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js`](../../../client/src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js)):**
    *   **Action:** Confirmed this file contains the comprehensive `validateFile` function (checking size and type). This became the single source of truth for file validation.
    *   **Reason:** To centralize file validation logic.

3.  **Receipts Validation ([`client/src/features/receipts/utils/validation.js`](../../../client/src/features/receipts/utils/validation.js)):**
    *   **Action:** Removed the local `validateFile` function.
    *   **Action:** Removed the import of `RECEIPT_CONFIG` as it was only used by the removed function.
    *   **Reason:** To eliminate redundant validation logic and rely on the shared `validateFile` function. Receipt-specific validation like `validateReceipt` remains.

4.  **Helper Utilities ([`client/src/shared/utils/helpers.js`](../../../client/src/shared/utils/helpers.js)):**
    *   **Action:** Removed the `validateFileType` function.
    *   **Reason:** This function was a duplicate of logic already present in the consolidated `validateFile` within `fileHelpers.js`.

5.  **Documents Validation ([`client/src/features/documents/utils/validation.js`](../../../client/src/features/documents/utils/validation.js)):**
    *   **Action:** Cleared the content of this file and added a comment indicating its consolidation. (Initially attempted deletion, but moved to clearing based on user feedback/process).
    *   **Reason:** The `validateFile` function previously in this file was redundant with the shared helper.

6.  **Component/Hook Updates:**
    *   **Action:** Updated [`client/src/features/documents/components/BaseDocumentHandler.js`](../../../client/src/features/documents/components/BaseDocumentHandler.js) to import and use `validateFile` from `client/src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js`.
    *   **Action:** Updated [`client/src/features/documents/hooks/useDocumentScanner.js`](../../../client/src/features/documents/hooks/useDocumentScanner.js) to import and use `validateFile` from `client/src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js`.
    *   **Action:** Updated [`client/src/features/documents/hooks/useOCR.js`](../../../client/src/features/documents/hooks/useOCR.js) to import `validateFile` from `client/src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js` (although it wasn't directly used in the remaining code after refactoring).
    *   **Reason:** To ensure all parts of the application use the single, consolidated validation function.

## II. File Organization (Moves to `/extra`)

Based on user feedback to move files instead of deleting them during cleanup:

*   **Action:** Attempted to move several files listed in the initial audit as "Redundant" or "Unused" from `client/src/features/documents/components/` and `client/src/features/documents/utils/` to the `client/extra/` directory.
*   **Files Targeted (Examples):** `validation.js`, `2ReceiptUploader.js`, `extra.ScannerInterface.js`, `FileUploader.js`, `ReceiptPreview.js`, `DocumentPreview.js`, `DocumentScanner.js`, `ReceiptScanner.js`.
*   **Result:** Most move commands failed with "Cannot find path" errors. This indicates these files were likely already moved or deleted in previous steps (potentially before the current context window or based on the initial audit actions before the user requested moving instead of deleting). The presence of these filenames within the `client/extra/` directory in the final file listing confirms they were successfully relocated at some point.
*   **Reason:** To archive potentially redundant or unused code for reference instead of permanently deleting it, as per user instruction.

## III. Documentation Generation

1.  **[`docs/developer/architecture/architecture-application-structure.md`](../developer/architecture/architecture-application-structure.md):**
    *   **Action:** Created this file.
    *   **Content:** Includes the current project folder structure (client, server, functions, docs, extra), key file responsibilities, and a Mermaid diagram illustrating the high-level application architecture.
    *   **Reason:** To provide an up-to-date map of the project layout after cleanup, as requested.

2.  **[`docs/maintenance/maintenance-technical-debt.md`](docs/maintenance/maintenance-technical-debt.md):**
    *   **Action:** Created this file.
    *   **Content:** Lists and prioritizes remaining technical debt items identified from the initial audit and cleanup process. Includes critical security rule gaps, direct Firebase access from the client, potential service/hook/component consolidations, and areas for improvement like typing and testing.
    *   **Reason:** To track outstanding issues and guide future refactoring efforts, as requested.

3.  **[`docs/maintenance/maintenance-technical-documentation.md`](docs/maintenance/maintenance-technical-documentation.md):**
    *   **Action:** Updated this existing file.
    *   **Content:** Refreshed descriptions of components/features to reflect the cleanup actions (e.g., noting validation consolidation, moved components). Added references to the new `project-structure.md` and `technical-debt.md` files. Removed outdated or duplicated sections where applicable.
    *   **Reason:** To ensure the main technical documentation aligns with the current project state and points to the more detailed structure and debt documents, as requested.
