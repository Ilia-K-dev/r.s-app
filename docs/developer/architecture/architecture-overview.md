This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Receipt Scanner application.

## Overview

The application follows a standard client-server architecture:

- **Client**: A React-based frontend responsible for user interface and interaction.
- **Server**: A Node.js/Express backend API that handles business logic, data processing, and communication with external services (Firebase, Google Cloud Vision).
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore is used for storing user data, receipts, inventory, etc.
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage is used for storing scanned receipt images.
- **External Services**:
    - Firebase Authentication for user management.
    - Google Cloud Vision API for OCR.

## Core Feature Architecture Details

### Document Scanning and OCR
- **Capture & Processing:** Documents are captured on the client-side (components like `FileUploader.js`, potentially native capabilities via libraries like `react-dropzone`). Client-side hooks (`useDocumentScanner.js`) manage the flow. Uploaded images are sent to the server (handled by `multer`). Server-side pre-processing might occur using `sharp` (`server/src/services/preprocessing.js`).
- **OCR Technology:** Google Cloud Vision API is the primary OCR engine on the server (`@google-cloud/vision`, integrated via `server/config/vision.js`, `server/src/services/document/documentProcessingService.js`, `server/src/services/document/visionService.js`). Tesseract.js might be used client-side for previews (`client/src/features/documents/hooks/useOCR.js`).
- **Data Extraction & Structure:** Server-side `documentProcessingService.js` orchestrates OCR. Extracted text and data are processed and mapped to the `Receipt` model (`server/src/models/Receipt.js`). Data is saved to Firestore via `receiptController.js`. Client displays previews (`DocumentPreview.js`, `ReceiptPreview.js`).
- **Status:** Complete / In-Progress.

### Receipt Management
- **Data Model & Storage:** Receipt data is defined by the `server/src/models/Receipt.js` model. Storage is managed server-side using Firestore via `firebase-admin`, linked to user accounts. Categories are managed separately (`server/src/models/Category.js`, `categoryController.js`).
- **Key Components:** Viewing (`Receiptlist.js`, `ReceiptCard.js`, `ReceiptDetail.js`, `ReceiptDetailPage.js`), Editing/Creating (`ReceiptForm.js`, `ReceiptEdit.js`), Filtering/Searching (`ReceiptFilters.js`, `SearchBar.js`), Hooks (`useReceipts.js`).
- **Categories & Items:** Users manage categories (`CategorySettings.js`). Receipts are associated with categories. Line items are likely stored as an array within the Receipt document.
- **Status:** Complete.

### Inventory Tracking
- **Data Structure:** Models include `Inventory.js`, `Product.js`, `StockMovement.js`, and `InventoryAlert.js`. Data is stored server-side in Firestore, linked to user accounts.
- **Stock Management:** Client components (`InventoryList.js`, `InventoryItem.js`, `StockManager.js`), hooks (`useInventory.js`, `useStockManagement.js`), and server-side logic (`inventoryController.js`, `server/src/services/inventory/stockService.js`, `server/src/utils/stockCalculations.js`) handle management and updates. Alerts are managed via client (`StockAlerts.js`) and server (`alertController.js`, `server/src/services/alert/`).
- **Item Tracking:** Tracking is based on stock movements (`StockMovement.js`).
- **Status:** Complete / In-Progress.

### Analytics and Reporting
- **Charts & Visualization:** Multiple chart components (`SpendingChart.js`, `CategoryBreakdown.js`, `SpendingTrends.js`, `BudgetProgress.js`, `DonutChart.js`, `ChartWrapper.js`) using libraries like `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2`, `recharts`. Dashboard components aggregate visualizations.
- **Data Aggregation & Calculation:** Client hooks (`useAnalytics.js`, `useReports.js`) and utilities (`analyticsCalculations.js`) handle data. Primary aggregation is server-side (`analyticsController.js`, `reportController.js`, `server/src/services/analytics/`, `server/src/services/report/`) potentially using Firestore queries or Cloud Functions.
- **Report Generation:** Specific report views exist (`CategoryReportPage.js`, `BudgetAnalysis.js`). Backend provides endpoints (`analyticsRoutes.js`, `reportRoutes.js`).
- **Status:** Complete.

## Components

### Frontend (Client)

- **UI Components**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: (Specify state management library if used, e.g., Context API, Redux)
- **Routing**: (Specify routing library if used, e.g., React Router)
- **API Interaction**: Communicates with the backend API via RESTful endpoints.

### Backend (Server)

- **API Endpoints**: Exposed via Express.js routes.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and orchestrate responses.
- **Services**: Contain business logic for features like OCR processing, data validation, inventory updates, etc.
- **Middleware**: Used for authentication, request validation, error handling, etc.
- **Database Interaction**: Uses Firebase Admin SDK to interact with Firestore and Storage.
