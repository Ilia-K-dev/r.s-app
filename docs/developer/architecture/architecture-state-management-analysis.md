This document analyzes the state management patterns and flow within the client-side of the Receipt Scanner application.

## Observed State Management Patterns

Based on the analysis of the client-side codebase, the following state management patterns are observed:

### Local Component State (`useState`)

The `useState` hook is widely used across various components and custom hooks (`client/src/shared/components/`, `client/src/features/`). This is the primary mechanism for managing local state within individual components, such as form data, loading indicators, error states, visibility toggles (e.g., modals, filters), and pagination details.

### Context API (`useContext`, `createContext`, `AuthProvider`, `ToastProvider`)

The React Context API is used for managing and providing shared state to multiple components without prop drilling.
    *   `AuthContext` (`client/src/core/contexts/AuthContext.js`): Manages and provides the user's authentication state (`user`, `loading`) to components throughout the application.
    *   `ToastContext` (`client/src/core/contexts/ToastContext.js`): Manages and provides state and functions related to displaying toast notifications.

### Custom Hooks (`use...` hooks)

Custom hooks are used to encapsulate stateful logic and side effects, making it reusable across components. Many of these hooks manage state related to data fetching, loading, and errors for specific features (e.g., `useInventory`, `useReceipts`, `useAnalytics`, `useCategories`, `useReports`, `useDocumentScanner`, `useOCR`, `useStockManagement`, `useSettings`). The `useLocalStorage` hook is used for managing state persisted in local storage.

## State Flow and Sharing

*   **Component Hierarchy:** State is passed down from parent components to child components via props. For state that needs to be accessed by components at different levels of the tree, the Context API is utilized (`AuthContext`, `ToastContext`).
*   **Data Fetching State:** Custom hooks often manage the state related to asynchronous data fetching operations, including loading status, error status, and the fetched data itself. This state is then provided to the components using these hooks.
*   **Global vs. Local State:** Authentication and Toast notifications are managed as global or application-wide state using Context. Feature-specific data and UI-related states are managed either locally within components or within feature-specific custom hooks.

## Absence of Centralized Global State Management Library

Based on the analysis, there is no indication of a dedicated centralized global state management library such as Redux, Zustand, or MobX being used in the application. State sharing beyond direct parent-child relationships and the provided contexts is handled through the Context API and potentially prop drilling.

## Potential Considerations

### Prop Drilling

In areas where state needs to be shared across several levels of nested components without a dedicated context, prop drilling might occur, potentially making the code harder to maintain.
### State Colocation

While custom hooks help colocate stateful logic, ensuring that state is managed at the appropriate level in the component tree (colocation) is important for performance and maintainability.

This analysis provides an overview of the state management approach on the client side, highlighting the use of local component state, Context API for shared state, and custom hooks for encapsulating logic.
