# RTK Query Migration Implementation

This document details the process and implementation of migrating the client-side data fetching and state management to RTK Query.

## Motivation

The migration to RTK Query aims to simplify data fetching logic, centralize API state management, and leverage built-in caching and invalidation capabilities, reducing boilerplate and improving developer experience.

## Store Setup

The Redux store is configured using `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`. The API services (`receiptApi`, `analyticsApi`) are added to the store's reducer using `reducerPath` and their middleware is included using `getDefaultMiddleware().concat(...)`. The `setupListeners` function is called to enable features like `refetchOnFocus` and `refetchOnReconnect`.

## API Service Definitions

API service definitions are created using `createApi` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react`. Each service defines its `reducerPath`, `baseQuery`, and a set of endpoints (queries and mutations).

*   **`receiptApi.js`**: Defines endpoints for fetching and manipulating receipt data.
*   **`analyticsApi.js`**: Defines endpoints for fetching analytics data.

## Hook Migration

Existing data fetching hooks (e.g., `useReceipts`) are refactored to use the auto-generated hooks from the RTK Query API services (e.g., `useGetReceiptsQuery`, `useUploadReceiptMutation`). This replaces manual data fetching logic with RTK Query's declarative approach.

## Caching and Invalidation

RTK Query provides automatic caching of fetched data. Invalidation strategies are implemented within the API service definitions using tags and `invalidatesTags` to automatically refetch data when relevant mutations occur.
