## Introduction

Ensuring accessibility is crucial for creating inclusive applications. These guidelines aim to help developers build a user interface that can be easily used by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

## ARIA Attributes

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes provide semantic meaning to elements, allowing assistive technologies to better understand and interact with the content.

*   Use `aria-label` to provide a descriptive label for interactive elements when the visual text is not sufficient.
*   Use `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` to associate elements with their labels or descriptions.
*   Use ARIA roles (`role="..."`) to define the purpose of an element when the native HTML element doesn't convey the correct semantic meaning.
*   Use ARIA states and properties (`aria-expanded`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-current`, etc.) to communicate the current state or properties of an element.

## Keyboard Navigation

Users who cannot use a mouse rely on keyboard navigation. Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable using a keyboard.

*   Use semantic HTML elements (buttons, links, form controls) as they are naturally keyboard interactive.
*   Ensure a logical tab order using the `tabindex` attribute when necessary (avoid negative `tabindex` values other than `-1`).
*   Provide clear visual focus indicators for the element that currently has keyboard focus.

## Screen Reader Support

Screen readers are used by visually impaired users to read out the content of the screen.

*   Ensure all important content is available as text.
*   Use appropriate ARIA attributes to provide context and information to screen readers.
*   Use the `client/src/utils/a11y/index.js` utility for announcing messages to screen readers when content changes dynamically (e.g., status updates).

## Error Handling and Accessibility

Inform users about errors in an accessible manner.

*   Use the `client/src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` component to gracefully handle errors and display a fallback UI.
*   Provide clear and descriptive error messages.
*   Ensure error messages are associated with the relevant form fields using ARIA attributes.

## Testing Accessibility

Regularly test the application's accessibility.

*   Use automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse).
*   Perform manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
*   Test with users who have disabilities to gather feedback.
