## Feature Flags in Deployment

Feature flags play a crucial role in our deployment strategy, enabling safer and more controlled releases.

-   **Controlled Rollouts:** New features or changes can be deployed to production in a disabled state. They can then be enabled gradually for specific user segments or environments using the feature flag Admin UI.
-   **Instant Rollbacks:** If a deployed feature causes issues, it can be immediately disabled by toggling the corresponding feature flag off. This provides a faster and less disruptive rollback mechanism compared to deploying a previous version of the code.
-   **A/B Testing:** Different versions of a feature (e.g., Firebase direct integration vs. legacy API) can be deployed simultaneously and controlled via feature flags for A/B testing.
-   **Reduced Deployment Risk:** By decoupling deployment from feature activation, we reduce the risk associated with each deployment.

Refer to the [Feature Toggle System Documentation](../feature-toggle-system.md) for details on managing feature flags.
