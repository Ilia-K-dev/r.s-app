## Overview

This document describes the architecture and implementation details for storing documents (including receipt images and extracted data) in the Receipt Scanner application.

## Storage Mechanisms

[Describe the primary storage mechanisms used, primarily Firebase Storage and Firestore.]

## Data Models

[Describe the data models used for representing documents and their metadata in Firestore.]

## Firebase Storage Implementation

[Explain the implementation details of using Firebase Storage for document files, including file organization, naming, and access patterns.]

## Firestore Implementation

[Explain how Firestore is used to store document metadata and link it to the files in Firebase Storage.]

## Security Considerations

[Discuss the security aspects of document storage, referencing relevant Firebase Security Rules.]

## Data Synchronization and Offline Access

[Describe how document data is synchronized and accessed when the application is offline.]

## Future Considerations

[Planned or potential future changes to the document storage architecture.]
