## Overview

This document details the technical implementation of the authentication system in the Receipt Scanner application.

## Component Architecture

The authentication system involves the following key components:

-   **Client-Side:**
    -   `AuthContext.js`: Manages global authentication state using React Context.
    -   `useAuth.js`: Custom hook for accessing authentication state and functions in components.
    -   `authService.js`: Low-level service wrapping Firebase Client SDK auth functions (Note: Appears largely redundant with `useAuth` hook).
    -   UI Components (`LoginPage.js`, `RegisterPage.js`, `ForgotPasswordPage.js`, `AuthGuard.js`): Provide user interface and route protection.
-   **Server-Side (if applicable):**
    -   `auth.js` (middleware): Verifies Firebase ID tokens for protected routes.
    -   `authController.js`: Handles server-side authentication logic (Note: Contains potentially insecure and redundant endpoints).
    -   `authRoutes.js`: Defines server-side authentication API routes.

## Client-side Implementation

Client-side authentication is primarily handled by the Firebase Authentication Client SDK, wrapped in the `useAuth` hook and managed via `AuthContext`.

-   **State Management:** `AuthContext` uses `onAuthStateChanged` to listen for Firebase Auth state changes and updates the global `user` state.
-   **Authentication Operations:** The `useAuth` hook provides functions (`login`, `register`, `logout`, `resetPassword`, `updateUserProfile`) that wrap Firebase Client SDK methods, incorporating loading state management and detailed error handling.
-   **Token Handling:** The client automatically attaches the Firebase Auth ID token to outgoing API requests via an Axios interceptor.

## Server-side Components

[Detail the client-side implementation using React/React Native and Firebase Authentication SDK.]

## Server-side Components

The backend server includes components for handling authentication-related requests and verifying tokens:

-   **Authentication Middleware (`server/src/middleware/auth/auth.js`):** The `authenticateUser` middleware verifies Firebase ID tokens sent by the client using `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token, true)`. It attaches decoded user info to `req.user` for valid tokens.
-   **Authentication Controller (`server/src/controllers/authController.js`):** Handles logic for server-side `/auth` routes. It uses Firebase Admin SDK for operations like checking email existence, creating users (Note: potentially redundant with client-side), generating custom tokens (Note: unclear purpose alongside ID tokens), and verifying ID tokens.
-   **Authentication Routes (`server/src/routes/authRoutes.js`):** Defines the Express routes for authentication endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/verify-token`).

## API References

[Reference relevant Firebase Authentication API documentation or any custom backend API endpoints.]

## Common Issues and Solutions

[List common issues encountered with authentication and their solutions.]
