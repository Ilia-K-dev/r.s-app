## Overview

This document provides detailed information on the usage and configuration of Firebase Authentication within the Receipt Scanner application.

## Firebase Authentication Methods

[Describe the specific Firebase Authentication methods used (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In, etc.).]

## Firebase Authentication SDK Usage

[Explain how the Firebase Authentication SDK is integrated and used in the client-side code.]

## Custom Token Usage (if applicable)

[If custom tokens are used, explain the process of generating and verifying them, and the rationale behind their use.]

## Firebase Authentication Configuration

Client-side Firebase configuration is typically loaded from environment variables (`.env.development`). Server-side Firebase Admin SDK is initialized with service account credentials.

## Handling Authentication States

Authentication state is managed globally on the client-side using the `AuthContext`. The `onAuthStateChanged` listener from the Firebase Client SDK updates the `user` state in the context whenever the authentication state changes (login, logout).

## Error Handling with Firebase Auth

[Explain how authentication states are managed and persisted in the application.]

## Error Handling with Firebase Auth

Errors returned by the Firebase Authentication SDK are handled in the `useAuth` hook with specific error code mapping to provide user-friendly messages.

## Future Considerations

[Planned or potential future changes related to Firebase Authentication.]
