## Overview

This document describes the roles and permissions within the Receipt Scanner application and how they are used to control access to features and data, primarily enforced through Firebase Security Rules.

## Defined Roles

[Describe the different user roles defined in the application. Based on the analysis, roles might be implicitly managed through custom claims or data in Firestore.]

## Permissions per Role

[Detail the permissions associated with each role, specifying what actions users with each role can perform. These permissions are enforced by Firebase Security Rules.]

## Implementation of Authorization

[Explain how authorization is implemented. This primarily relies on Firebase Security Rules checking the authenticated user's ID and potentially custom claims or data in their user document in Firestore.]

## Firebase Security Rules and Roles

Firebase Security Rules are the primary mechanism for enforcing authorization. Rules check the authenticated user's `request.auth` object, which contains their `uid` and potentially custom claims set via the Firebase Admin SDK. Rules then grant or deny access based on the requested operation and the data being accessed.

## Future Considerations

[Planned or potential future changes to roles and permissions or authorization implementation.]
