## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for verifying the successful migration of the Receipt Scanner application to use the Firebase SDK directly, eliminating the dependency on the Express backend. The tests will cover all refactored functionality, security rules, and key user flows to ensure correctness, security, and a smooth user experience.

## Features Requiring Testing
The following features, which have been refactored to use Firebase direct integration, require comprehensive testing:

- User Authentication (Sign-up, Login, Logout, Password Reset)
- Receipt Management (Uploading, Viewing, Editing, Deleting Receipts)
- Document Processing (Uploading Documents, OCR, Classification)
- Inventory Management (Adding, Viewing, Editing, Deleting Inventory Items, Stock Movements)
- Analytics (Spending by Category, Monthly Spending, Top Merchants, Inventory Value Trend, Inventory Turnover)
- Feature Toggle System (Enabling/Disabling Firebase integration)

## Test Scenarios and Prioritization

### Priority 1: Critical Functionality & Security
- **User Authentication:**
  - Successful user registration and login with valid credentials.
  - Handling of invalid credentials and existing users during registration/login.
  - Secure password reset process.
  - Proper handling of authenticated and unauthenticated states.
- **Receipt Management:**
  - Successful uploading of various receipt file types.
  - Accurate display of uploaded receipt data.
  - Correct editing and deletion of owned receipts.
  - Verification that users cannot access, modify, or delete receipts owned by other users (Security).
- **Document Processing:**
  - Successful uploading of document file types (images, PDFs).
  - Accurate OCR extraction from uploaded documents.
  - Correct document classification.
  - Verification of document security rules (ownership, file types, size limits).
- **Inventory Management:**
  - Successful creation, viewing, editing, and deletion of owned inventory items.
  - Accurate recording and display of stock movements.
  - Verification that users cannot access, modify, or delete inventory data owned by other users (Security).
- **Feature Toggle System:**
  - Correct switching between Firebase direct integration and API fallback using the feature toggle.
  - Verification that the application functions correctly in both states.
  - Testing the automatic fallback mechanism on Firebase errors.

### Priority 2: Core Functionality & Edge Cases
- **Receipt Management:**
  - Handling of large receipt files.
  - Uploading receipts with missing or incomplete data.
  - Testing filtering and sorting of receipts.
- **Document Processing:**
  - Handling of large document files.
  - OCR accuracy with varying document quality.
  - Classification accuracy with different document content.
- **Inventory Management:**
  - Handling of large inventory lists and stock movement history.
  - Testing filtering and sorting of inventory data.
- **Analytics:**
  - Accurate calculation of all analytics metrics with various datasets.
  - Performance of analytics calculations with large datasets.
  - Verification of caching effectiveness.

### Priority 3: Comprehensive Coverage & Automation
- **Security Rules:**
  - Exhaustive testing of all security rules for all collections and paths (read, write, update, delete) with various authenticated and unauthenticated user contexts, including edge cases.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - End-to-end testing of key user flows involving multiple steps and interactions with different services.
- **Test Automation:**
  - Successful execution of all tests in a CI/CD pipeline using the Firebase emulator.
  - Accurate test coverage reporting.
  - Automated security rule testing as part of the CI/CD process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All Priority 1 and Priority 2 test scenarios pass successfully.
- Security rules tests demonstrate that data is protected according to the defined rules.
- Integration tests confirm key user flows function correctly.
- Test automation is configured and runs reliably.
- Test coverage meets the project's defined thresholds (to be determined).

## Next Steps
- Implement unit tests for all Firebase service implementations.
- Implement comprehensive security rules tests.
- Implement integration tests for key user flows.
- Set up test automation for continuous validation.
- Document implementation details and challenges in the migration log.
- Update the checklist upon completion of each testing phase.
