/**
 * client/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts
 * Last Modified: 2025-05-22 04:18:00
 * Modified By: Cline
 *
 * Purpose: Redux Toolkit slice for managing authentication state.
 * Changes Made: Created a placeholder file to resolve build error.
 * Reasoning: The build was failing because this file was missing, causing a "Module not found" error. Creating a placeholder allows the build to proceed.
