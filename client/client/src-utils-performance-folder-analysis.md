# src/utils/performance/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/utils/performance/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/utils/performance/`
- **Purpose**: Contains utility functions related to application performance, specifically client-side caching.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes utilities for implementing a runtime cache using an LRU strategy.
- **Relationship**: These utilities can be used by services or hooks to cache data and improve application performance by reducing redundant data fetching.
- **Status**: Contains Performance Utilities (Caching).

## File: cache.js
- **Purpose**: Defines client-side caching utilities using an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports a `runtimeCache` instance configured with a maximum number of items and a maximum age (5 minutes). Exports placeholder functions for `cachedApiCall` and implemented functions for `invalidateCacheEntry` (deletes a specific key) and `clearCache` (resets the entire cache) that interact with the `runtimeCache`.
- **Dependencies**: `lru-cache`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a basic in-memory caching mechanism with expiration. The `cachedApiCall` function is a placeholder and needs implementation.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Includes a comment about the last update date. The `cachedApiCall` function is not implemented.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Implement the `cachedApiCall` function to utilize the `runtimeCache` for caching API responses. Consider integrating with a more persistent caching mechanism (e.g., IndexedDB) for offline support or larger datasets if needed.
