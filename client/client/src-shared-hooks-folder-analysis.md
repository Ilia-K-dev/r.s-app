# src/shared/hooks/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/shared/hooks/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/shared/hooks/`
- **Purpose**: Contains reusable custom React hooks that provide common functionalities or access to shared state/contexts.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes hooks for interacting with local storage and consuming the Toast Context.
- **Relationship**: These hooks are used by components and other hooks throughout the application to access shared logic or state in a clean and reusable way.
- **Status**: Contains Shared Hooks.

## File: useLocalStorage.js
- **Purpose**: A custom React hook for interacting with the browser's local storage.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Takes a `key` and `initialValue`. Returns the stored value, a `setValue` function to update state and local storage, and a `removeValue` function to remove the item from local storage. Initializes state by reading from local storage, handles JSON parsing, and includes error handling and logging. Uses `useEffect` to listen for storage changes from other tabs/windows.
- **Dependencies**: `react`, `../utils/logger`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a convenient and synchronized way to use local storage in React components. Handles initial value, updates, removal, and cross-tab synchronization.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Contains "//correct" comments which should be removed.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Consider adding support for different serialization/deserialization methods if needed.

## File: useToast.js

- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Uses the `useContext` hook to access the `ToastContext`. Throws an error if used outside of a `ToastProvider`. Returns the context value (which includes `showToast`).
- **Dependencies**: `react`, `../../core/contexts/ToastContext`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Simple hook for accessing context functionality.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
