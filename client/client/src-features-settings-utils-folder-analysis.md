# src/features/settings/utils/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/features/settings/utils/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/features/settings/utils/`
- **Purpose**: Contains utility functions that support the settings feature, primarily for working with settings data structures.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes utility functions for getting default settings and accessing/updating nested setting values.
- **Relationship**: These utility functions are used by settings-related components, hooks, or services to manipulate settings data.
- **Status**: Contains Settings Utility Functions.

## File: settingsHelpers.js
- **Purpose**: Provides utility functions for working with settings data structures.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports `getDefaultSettings` which returns a basic object with default notification, theme, currency, and language settings. Exports `getSettingValue` which takes a settings object and a dot notation key path and returns the corresponding nested value. Exports `setSettingValue` which takes a settings object, a dot notation key path, and a value, and updates the nested value in the settings object.
- **Dependencies**: None (pure utility functions).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Simple utility functions for accessing and manipulating nested object properties using dot notation.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure consistency between the `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` defined here and any default settings defined elsewhere (e.g., in `useSettings.js`). Add error handling to `getSettingValue` and `setSettingValue` for invalid paths.
