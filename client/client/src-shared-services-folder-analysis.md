# src/shared/services/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/shared/services/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/shared/services/`
- **Purpose**: Contains reusable service-level logic for interacting with external APIs, logging, and browser storage.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes services for making API calls (centralized Axios instance and specific API endpoints), a logger utility, and utilities for interacting with Firebase Storage and browser local/session storage.
- **Relationship**: These services are used by hooks and other parts of the application to perform side effects like data fetching, logging, and storage operations.
- **Status**: Contains Shared Services.

## File: api.js
- **Purpose**: Defines a centralized Axios instance for making API calls to the backend and includes request/response interceptors. Exports specific API service objects for different domains.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Creates an Axios instance with base URL and timeout from `api.config.js`. Request interceptor attaches Firebase Auth token and logs requests in development. Response interceptor handles 401 errors with token refresh and retry, extracts user-friendly error messages, and logs errors. Exports `receiptApi`, `categoryApi`, `inventoryApi`, `analyticsApi`, and `exportApi` objects with methods for interacting with corresponding backend endpoints.
- **Dependencies**: `axios`, `../../core/config/firebase` (for `auth`), `./logger`, `../../core/config/api.config`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a structured way to handle API communication, authentication, and error handling. The token refresh logic is implemented in the response interceptor.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure comprehensive error handling for all API calls. Consider adding more detailed logging or tracing for requests and responses.

## File: logger.js
- **Purpose**: A simple client-side logger utility for logging messages to the browser console.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports `info`, `error`, `debug`, and `warn` methods that wrap `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.debug`, and `console.warn` respectively. Debug messages are conditional on `NODE_ENV` being 'development'. Includes JSDoc comments.
- **Dependencies**: None.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Basic logging utility.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Consider integrating with a more robust logging service for production environments.

## File: receiptApi.js
- **Purpose**: Defines placeholder hooks for fetching and uploading receipts.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports `useGetReceiptsQuery` and `useUploadReceiptMutation` hooks. These hooks currently return dummy data and basic loading/error states.
- **Dependencies**: None (placeholders).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Placeholder implementation. The actual logic for these hooks is likely intended to be implemented elsewhere, possibly using a library like RTK Query to interact with the backend API defined in `api.js`.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Contains placeholder implementations.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Implement the actual data fetching and mutation logic for these hooks, likely by integrating with the `receiptApi` object defined in `api.js`.

## File: storage.js
- **Purpose**: Provides reusable service-level functions for interacting with Firebase Storage and browser storage (local and session).
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports functions for Firebase Storage operations (`uploadFile`, `uploadImage`, `deleteFile`, `getFileUrl`) using `firebase/storage` and the `storage` instance from firebase config. Exports `localCache` and `sessionStorage` objects with methods (`set`, `get`, `remove`, `clear`) for interacting with browser storage, including TTL for local cache. Includes a `generateThumbnail` function using `createImageBitmap` and `canvas`. Includes error handling and logging.
- **Dependencies**: `firebase/storage`, `../../core/config/firebase` (for `storage`), `../utils/logger`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a centralized interface for various storage operations. Includes specific logic for image uploads and thumbnail generation.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Contains "//correct" comments which should be removed.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure robust error handling for all storage operations. Consider adding progress tracking for file uploads.
