# src/core/config/__tests__/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/core/config/__tests__/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/core/config/__tests__/`
- **Purpose**: Contains unit tests for the core configuration files, specifically focusing on the feature flags utility.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes a test file for the feature flags utility functions.
- **Relationship**: This folder is part of the client's testing suite, ensuring the correct functionality of core configuration logic.
- **Status**: Contains Core Configuration Unit Tests.

## File: featureFlags.test.js
- **Purpose**: Contains unit tests for the feature flags utility functions (`isFeatureEnabled`, `enableFeature`, `disableFeature`, `getAllFeatureFlags`, `loadFeatureFlags`, `saveFeatureFlags`, `startPerformanceTimer`, `endPerformanceTimer`, `stopPerformanceTimer`).
