# Duplicated Folders Analysis

This document analyzes potentially duplicated or mistakenly created folders within the `client/` directory.

## Folder: client/client/

- **Path**: `client/client/`
- **Why does this folder exist?**: Based on the task description, this folder was likely created by the previous analyst who mistakenly assumed it was a continuation of the main `client/` directory.
- **What differences exist between its files and those in the real frontend?**: A recursive listing of this directory found no files. This indicates that despite the mistaken path, no actual files were created or copied into this nested folder.
- **Can it be deleted safely?**: Yes, this folder appears to be empty and the result of a navigational error during previous analysis. It can be safely deleted.

## Folder: extra/extra/

- **Path**: `extra/extra/`
- **Why does this folder exist?**: This nested directory likely contains outdated or experimental files from previous development or analysis efforts. The file names suggest they might be older versions of chart components and environment configuration.
- **What differences exist between its files and those in the real frontend?**: The directory contains `.env`, `extraBarChart.js`, `extraDonutChart.js`, `extraLineChart.js`, and `extraPieChart.js`. These files are not part of the current, active codebase in the main `client/` directory. The chart files appear to be older versions of components found in `src/shared/components/charts/`.
- **Can it be deleted safely?**: Yes, based on the file names and the likely purpose of the `extra/` directory, these files appear to be outdated or experimental and can be safely deleted.

## Recommendations
- The `client/client/` directory should be removed as it is empty and serves no purpose.
- The `extra/extra/` directory and its contents should be removed as they likely contain outdated or experimental files.
