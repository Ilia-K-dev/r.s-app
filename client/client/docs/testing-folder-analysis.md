## File: receipt-scanner-testing-strategy.md
- **Purpose**: Outlines the testing strategy for the Receipt Scanner application, with a focus on Firebase integration.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Describes current testing issues (environment setup, module resolution, emulator connectivity, security rules), testing objectives (validate Firebase, feature toggles, offline, security rules, integration coverage), testing levels (unit, integration, security rules), testing environment setup (Firebase emulator, Jest config, mocks), testing priorities, test data management, and test patterns for Firebase integration.
- **Dependencies**: Refers to various testing frameworks (Jest, Testing Library), Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage), and related utilities/configurations (`.env` files, `jest.config.js`, CI/CD workflows).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the testing approach. Includes code examples for setting up the testing environment and writing tests. Highlights existing issues that need to be addressed.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Mentions several unresolved testing environment issues. The document itself is a strategy and does not contain executable code with bugs or dead code.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Address the identified testing environment issues. Implement the outlined testing strategy by writing and maintaining the described unit, integration, and security rules tests. Keep the documentation updated as the testing strategy evolves.
