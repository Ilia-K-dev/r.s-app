# src/contexts/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/contexts/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/contexts/`
- **Purpose**: Contains React Contexts for managing global application state.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes a context and provider for managing the application's theme.
- **Relationship**: The contexts defined here are used by components throughout the application to access and update shared state.
- **Status**: Contains React Contexts.

## File: ThemeContext.js
- **Purpose**: Defines a React Context and Provider for managing the application's theme (light or dark mode).
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**:
    - `ThemeContext`: The React Context object.
    - `ThemeProvider`: A React component that provides the theme state (`isDark`) and a function to update it (`setIsDark`) to its children. It initializes the theme state based on local storage or the user's system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).
    - `useTheme`: A custom hook to easily consume the `ThemeContext`.
    - Uses `useEffect` to persist the theme preference in local storage and apply a 'dark' class to the document element.
- **Dependencies**: `react`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Standard implementation of a theme context using React hooks and local storage.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: The `useEffect` dependency array includes `i18n.language`, which seems unrelated to theme management and might be a leftover or incorrect dependency.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Remove `i18n.language` from the `useEffect` dependency array in `ThemeContext.js` as it is not used within the effect and is unrelated to theme changes. Consider adding support for system theme changes while the app is running.
