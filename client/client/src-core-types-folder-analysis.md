# src/core/types/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/core/types/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/core/types/`
- **Purpose**: Contains core TypeScript type definitions used throughout the client application. These types define the shape of data structures for consistency and type safety.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes type definitions for API responses, authentication-related data, and common data structures like receipts, inventory items, and user settings.
- **Relationship**: These type definitions are imported and used by components, hooks, services, and other parts of the client application to ensure data is handled correctly according to predefined structures.
- **Status**: Contains Core TypeScript Types.

## File: api.ts
- **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for common API response structures and specific data structures returned by API endpoints.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports interfaces such as `ApiResponse<T>`, `PaginatedResponse<T>`, `DocumentUploadResponse`, `InventoryItem`, `StockMovement`, `AnalyticsData`, and `AlertSettings`. These interfaces specify the expected properties and their types for data received from the backend API.
- **Dependencies**: None (defines types).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Standard TypeScript interface definitions.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure these interfaces accurately reflect the actual data structures returned by the backend API and keep them updated with any API changes.

## File: authTypes.ts
- **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for authentication-related data structures.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports interfaces such as `User`, `AuthState`, `LoginCredentials`, and `RegistrationData`. These interfaces define the shape of data related to user information, authentication state, and the data required for login and registration.
- **Dependencies**: None (defines types).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Standard TypeScript interface definitions.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure these interfaces align with the data structures used by the authentication service and components.

## File: common.ts
- **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for common data structures used across different features of the application.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports interfaces such as `DocumentItem`, `Receipt`, `InventoryFilter`, `DateRange`, `BudgetCategory`, and `UserSettings`. These interfaces define the shape of data commonly used in multiple parts of the application, promoting consistency.
- **Dependencies**: None (defines types).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Standard TypeScript interface definitions.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Add type definitions for any other common data structures used throughout the application. Ensure consistency between these types and the data structures used in the backend and API definitions.
