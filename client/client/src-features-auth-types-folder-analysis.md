# src/features/auth/types/ Folder Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the `src/features/auth/types/` directory and its contents.

## Folder Overview
- **Path**: `src/features/auth/types/`
- **Purpose**: Contains TypeScript type definitions specifically for the authentication feature.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes a comprehensive set of type definitions for authentication-related data structures, states, and service interfaces.
- **Relationship**: These type definitions are used by the components, hooks, and services within the authentication feature to ensure type safety and consistency. They appear to be more detailed than the authentication types defined in `src/core/types/authTypes.ts`.
- **Status**: Contains Authentication TypeScript Types.

## File: authTypes.ts
- **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for authentication-related data structures, states, and service interfaces.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**: Exports interfaces and types such as `UserProfile`, `LoginCredentials`, `RegisterData`, `User` (extended from `UserProfile`), `AuthState`, `PasswordResetRequest`, `AuthMethod`, `AuthService` interface, `AuthErrorType` enum, `AuthError` class, `OAuthProviderConfig`, and `AuthPreferences`. These define the shape of data used within the authentication feature.
- **Dependencies**: None (defines types).
- **Complexity/Notes**: Provides a detailed and comprehensive set of types for the authentication feature. The presence of a similar file in `src/core/types/` suggests potential duplication or an intended separation between core and feature-specific types.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: Includes JSDoc comments explaining the purpose of each interface and type.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Confirm which `authTypes.ts` file is the primary source of truth for authentication types. If `src/features/auth/types/authTypes.ts` is the intended one, consider removing or deprecating `src/core/types/authTypes.ts` to avoid confusion and potential inconsistencies. Ensure all authentication-related code consistently uses the types from this file.
