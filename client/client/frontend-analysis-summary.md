## Analysis of Duplicated/Mistaken Folders

Analysis of potentially duplicated or mistakenly created folders has been completed.

[Link to Duplicated Folders Analysis](duplicated-folders-analysis.md)

---

I understand your feedback that some folders like `extra/` and `__mocks__/` might exist in other locations within the `client/` directory and contain files that need analysis. To address this and ensure a more complete picture, I will perform a recursive file listing from the root of the current working directory (`c:/Users/user/Documents/app.v3/client`) to try and locate these folders and any other relevant source code files that might have been missed due to the previous truncation. I will exclude `node_modules/` from this search.
