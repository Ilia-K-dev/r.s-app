## Folder Overview

- **Purpose**: Contains custom React hooks specifically for the receipts feature, providing access to receipt data and functions, primarily interacting with the backend API.
- **Contents Summary**: Includes a hook for fetching and uploading receipts.
- **Relationship**: This hook is used by receipt-related components and pages to manage receipt data and initiate upload operations. It serves as an interface between the UI and the `receiptApi` service.
- **Status**: Contains Receipts Hooks.

## File: useReceipts.js
- **Purpose**: A custom React hook for fetching and uploading receipts.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**:
    - Uses `useGetReceiptsQuery` from `../../../shared/services/receiptApi` to fetch a paginated list of receipts.
    - Uses `useUploadReceiptMutation` from `../../../shared/services/receiptApi` to get a function for uploading receipts and track the upload status.
    - Returns the fetched `receipts`, `hasMore` status, `isLoading` state for fetching, `error` state, the `uploadReceipt` mutation function, and the `isUploading` state.
- **Dependencies**: `../../../shared/services/receiptApi`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: A concise hook that leverages query and mutation hooks from a service file (likely using a library like RTK Query).
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Ensure the `receiptApi` service is correctly implemented and handles interactions with the backend API for fetching and uploading receipts. Consider adding options for filtering and sorting when fetching receipts through this hook.
