## üìÑ File: BaseDocumentHandler.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a base component for handling document uploads and captures. It offers core functionality for file selection, camera integration (optional), preview display (optional), and basic image manipulation features like rotation, zoom, and fullscreen view. It is designed to be extended or used as a foundational component for more specific document handling requirements within the application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `BaseDocumentHandler`: A functional React component.
- Uses `useState` hooks to manage component state: `file` (selected or captured file), `preview` (URL for displaying the file preview), `rotation` (for image rotation), `zoom` (for image zoom level), `loading` (boolean for operation in progress), `error` (string or null for error messages), and `isFullscreen` (boolean for preview fullscreen state).
- Uses `useRef` for `fileInputRef` to interact with the hidden file input element.
- Uses `useCallback` (partially applied in the provided snippet) for optimizing event handlers.
- Imports various icons from `lucide-react` (`Camera`, `Upload`, `X`, `RotateCw`, `ZoomIn`, `ZoomOut`, `Maximize`, `Minimize`, `File`).
- Imports UI components: `Button` (from `shared/components/forms`), `Alert`, and `Card` (from `shared/components/ui`).
- Imports `useToast` hook (from `shared/hooks`).
- Imports `validateFile` utility (from `shared/utils/fileHelpers`).
- Defines constants: `ACCEPTED_TYPES` (object mapping MIME types to file extensions) and `MAX_FILE_SIZE` (in bytes).
- Accepts props to customize behavior: `onCapture`, `onUpload`, `onProcess` (callback functions), `documentType` (string), `allowedTypes` (object), `maxSize` (number), `allowCamera` (boolean), `showPreview` (boolean), and `className` (string).

### üß† Logic Overview
The component provides UI elements (buttons, hidden file input) that trigger file selection or camera capture workflows. The `handleFileSelect` function is triggered when a user selects a file via the file input. It calls `validateFile` to check if the selected file meets the `allowedTypes` and `maxSize` criteria. If validation passes and `showPreview` is true for an image file, it generates a preview URL (using an undefined `generatePreview` function). The selected file and preview URL are stored in the component's state. If an `onUpload` prop is provided, it is called with the selected file. The `handleCameraCapture` function (partially shown) is intended to trigger a camera capture workflow via the `onCapture` prop, validate the captured file, generate a preview, and update the state. Loading and error states are managed during these operations, and errors are displayed using the `Alert` component and `useToast` hook. The component also includes state variables for `rotation`, `zoom`, and `isFullscreen`, suggesting functionality for manipulating the displayed preview, although the implementation details for these actions are not present in the provided snippet.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The provided code snippet is incomplete, specifically lacking the implementation details for image manipulation (rotation, zoom, fullscreen toggling) and the `onProcess` functionality. A full analysis of these features is not possible without the complete code.
- The `validateFile` utility is imported but its internal logic is not visible in this file, making it difficult to fully assess its validation capabilities and potential limitations.
- The `generatePreview` function is used within the `handleFileSelect` and `handleCameraCapture` functions but is not defined in the provided snippet. Its implementation is unknown.
- Error handling, while present, relies on generic error messages thrown by `validateFile` or hardcoded strings ("Failed to capture image"). More specific and user-friendly error messages based on the exact reason for validation failure (e.g., "Invalid file type", "File too large") or capture failure would improve the user experience.
- The component combines file handling, UI state, and potential image manipulation logic. Depending on the complexity of the image manipulation features, this component could become quite large and potentially harder to maintain.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Obtain and analyze the complete code for `BaseDocumentHandler.js` to fully understand and document the implementation of image manipulation features (rotation, zoom, fullscreen) and the `onProcess` functionality.
- Analyze the `validateFile` utility (located in `shared/utils/fileHelpers.js`) to understand its validation rules, error handling, and ensure it meets the application's requirements.
- Analyze the `generatePreview` function to understand how it creates preview URLs, especially for different file types (images, PDFs).
- Enhance error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages to the user, potentially by catching specific error types thrown by `validateFile` or the capture process.
- If the image manipulation logic is extensive, consider extracting it into a separate custom hook or utility module to improve the component's readability and maintainability.

## üìÑ File: useCamera.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a custom React hook for accessing and controlling the user's camera, including starting/stopping the camera stream, capturing photos from the stream, and switching between available camera modes (environment/user).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `useCamera`: A functional React hook.
- Uses `useState` for managing the camera `stream` (MediaStream object or null) and `error` (string or null) states.
- Uses `useCallback` to memoize the core functions: `startCamera`, `stopCamera`, `capturePhoto`, and `switchCamera`.
- Interacts with the browser's Web Media Devices API (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`).
- Uses a temporary HTMLVideoElement and HTMLCanvasElement within `capturePhoto` to process the video stream and generate a File object (JPEG).
- Returns the current `stream`, any `error`, the control functions (`startCamera`, `stopCamera`, `capturePhoto`, `switchCamera`), and an `isActive` boolean derived from the `stream` state.

### üß† Logic Overview
The hook encapsulates the logic for interacting with the device camera. `startCamera` requests access to the camera media stream, preferring the 'environment' (rear) camera and specifying ideal video dimensions. The resulting `MediaStream` is stored in the `stream` state. `stopCamera` iterates through the tracks of the current `stream` and stops them, then clears the `stream` state. `capturePhoto` takes the current frame from the active video `stream`, draws it onto a dynamically created canvas, and converts the canvas content into a JPEG `File` object with a default name and type. `switchCamera` determines the current facing mode, stops the existing stream, and requests a new stream with the opposite facing mode ('user' or 'environment'). Error handling is included in each function to catch potential issues during camera access, capture, or switching, setting a generic error message in the state and re-throwing the error.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- Error handling is basic; it sets a generic error message in the state (e.g., "Failed to access camera", "Failed to capture photo") and re-throws the original error. More specific and user-friendly error messages based on the exact `MediaDevices` or canvas-related errors would be more informative for debugging and user feedback.
- The `capturePhoto` function creates and removes video and canvas elements directly in the DOM. While a common pattern for this task, it might be considered less "React-idiomatic" than managing these elements within a component's render tree or using refs more extensively.
- The hook doesn't explicitly handle scenarios where the user denies camera permissions after the initial `getUserMedia` call or revokes them later. The `error` state might capture this, but specific handling or guidance for the user is not included.
- The requested video resolution (`ideal: 1920x1080`) in `startCamera` and `switchCamera` is hardcoded. Making these constraints configurable via parameters to the hook could increase its flexibility.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Enhance error handling within each function to provide more specific and informative error messages to the user, potentially by inspecting the error object returned by `getUserMedia` or canvas operations.
- Consider if managing the temporary video and canvas elements within a dedicated component or using React refs more explicitly in the component that utilizes this hook would be a cleaner approach than direct DOM manipulation within the hook's `capturePhoto` function.
- Add explicit handling and user guidance for camera permission issues (denied, revoked).
- Allow the caller to specify video constraints (like resolution and facing mode preference) when calling `startCamera` and `switchCamera` by accepting parameters in these functions.

## üìÑ File: useDocumentProcessing.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a custom React hook to manage the state and logic for a multi-step document processing flow, including upload, OCR, and classification. It tracks loading, error, and progress, and includes basic support for cancellation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `useDocumentProcessing`: A functional React hook.
- Uses `useState` for managing `isLoading` (boolean), `error` (string or null), `progress` (number, 0-1 overall progress), `stepProgress` (object, progress for individual steps like upload, ocr, classification), and `documentData` (object or null, processed result) states.
- Uses `useCallback` for the `startProcessing` and `cancelProcessing` functions.
- Imports `documentProcessingService` (assumed to handle the actual processing steps) and `handleFirebaseError` utility (used for error processing).
- Includes state (`isCancelled`) and a function (`cancelProcessing`) for handling cancellation requests, although the actual cancellation logic in the service is a TODO.

### üß† Logic Overview
The hook orchestrates a sequence of asynchronous document processing steps (upload, OCR, classification) by calling corresponding functions in the `documentProcessingService`. It manages the overall loading state (`isLoading`) and tracks progress using both an overall `progress` value (from 0 to 1) and a `stepProgress` object for more granular step-by-step progress. It uses a `try...catch` block to handle errors during the processing flow, setting the `error` state and using the `handleFirebaseError` utility to potentially format the error message. The hook also provides a `cancelProcessing` function that sets an `isCancelled` flag. This flag is checked between processing steps to prevent subsequent steps from starting if cancellation is requested. The final result of the processing is stored in the `documentData` state.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The actual cancellation logic within the `documentProcessingService` functions is not implemented (marked with TODO comments). The hook's `isCancelled` state and checks only prevent subsequent steps from starting; they do not stop an ongoing asynchronous operation (like a large file upload or a long-running OCR process). True cancellation requires support within the underlying service functions.
- Progress tracking is rudimentary. The `processingStatus.progress` is updated with hardcoded percentages (25%, 75%, 100%) at the start of major steps, rather than reflecting the actual progress of the OCR or upload operations. The commented-out progress callbacks indicate an intention for more granular tracking, but this is not implemented in the called services.
- The `preprocessImage` step is commented out and the original file is used directly. This suggests that image preprocessing is either not yet implemented, intentionally skipped, or handled elsewhere. Its intended role in the processing flow is unclear from this code.
- The hook assumes the structure of the results returned by the `documentProcessingService` functions (e.g., expecting an `id` from `uploadDocument`, `text` from `processDocument`, and `classification`, `confidence` from `classifyDocument`). These assumptions need to be verified against the actual implementation of the service.
- The use of `handleFirebaseError` in the catch block seems potentially incorrect, as the errors thrown by `documentProcessingService` might not be Firebase-specific errors. A more general error handling approach that can process various types of errors from the service might be more appropriate here.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement the actual cancellation logic within the `documentProcessingService` functions (e.g., using AbortController for fetch/upload, or specific library cancellation features for OCR/classification) to enable true cancellation of ongoing operations when `cancelProcessing` is called.
- Update the `documentProcessingService` functions to accept and actively use progress callback functions, providing granular progress updates that the hook can use to accurately update the `progress` and `stepProgress` states.
- Clarify the role and implementation status of the `preprocessImage` step. If it's necessary, implement it in the service or a utility and integrate it into the relevant service functions (e.g., before upload or before client-side OCR).
- Verify the exact return types and data structures of the functions in `documentProcessingService` and adjust the hook's logic (e.g., how `documentData` is constructed) to match the actual service implementation.
- Review and refine the error handling in the catch block. Replace `handleFirebaseError` with a more general error processing logic or a utility function that can handle various types of errors thrown by the `documentProcessingService` and provide appropriate user-facing messages.

## üìÑ File: useDocumentScanner.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a custom React hook for handling the end-to-end process of scanning (or uploading) a document, performing client-side OCR using Tesseract.js, and saving the processed receipt data, including the uploaded image, to Firebase (Storage and Firestore) via a refactored receipt API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `useDocumentScanner`: A functional React hook.
- Uses `useState` for managing the processed `document` data (object or null), overall `loading` state (boolean), `error` state (string or null), and detailed `processingStatus` (object with `stage` and `progress`).
- Uses `useRef` for `cancelTokenRef` (intended for cancellation, but noted as not fully implemented for Tesseract).
- Uses `useCallback` to memoize the core functions: `validateDocument`, `processDocument`, `cancelProcessing`, and `resetScanner`.
- Imports `useAuth` hook (for user context), `useToast` hook (for user feedback), `logger` utility (for logging), `validateFile` utility (for file validation), `performOcr` service (for client-side OCR), and `receiptApi` service (for Firebase interactions).

### üß† Logic Overview
The hook's primary function, `processDocument`, orchestrates the document processing workflow. It first validates the input `file` using the `validateDocument` helper (which in turn uses `validateFile`). If validation passes, it proceeds to perform client-side OCR on the file using the `performOcr` service. After obtaining the OCR result (text and confidence), it prepares a `receiptData` object, currently including the raw extracted text and OCR confidence, along with a default `documentType`. This `receiptData` and the original `file` are then passed to the `receiptApi.createReceipt` function, which is assumed to handle both uploading the file to Firebase Storage and saving the receipt data to Firestore. The hook updates its state throughout this process, managing `loading`, `error`, and `processingStatus` to reflect the current stage and a hardcoded progress percentage. Upon successful completion, it sets the `document` state with the saved receipt data and shows a success toast. Error handling catches potential errors at any stage, logs them using `logger`, sets the `error` state (using `handleFirebaseError`, which might be inappropriate here), and shows an error toast. The `cancelProcessing` function is a placeholder that resets the state and shows a warning toast, but lacks the actual logic to stop ongoing async operations. `resetScanner` clears the hook's state. An `isProcessing` derived state is provided for convenience.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- Actual cancellation logic for ongoing asynchronous operations (specifically Tesseract.js OCR and Firebase Storage uploads within `receiptApi.createReceipt`) is not implemented. The `cancelProcessing` function and `cancelTokenRef` are present, but they do not actively stop these operations, only prevent subsequent steps from starting. This is a significant gap for long-running processes.
- Progress tracking is rudimentary. The `processingStatus.progress` is updated with hardcoded percentages (25%, 75%, 100%) at the start of major steps, rather than reflecting the actual progress of the OCR or upload operations. The commented-out progress callbacks indicate an intention for more granular tracking, but this is not implemented in the called services.
- The `preprocessImage` step is commented out, suggesting that image preprocessing (which might improve OCR accuracy) is not currently performed.
- The extraction of structured data (like merchant name, date, total) from the raw `ocrResult.text` is commented out and marked as a necessary future step. The current implementation only saves the raw text.
- The assumption that `receiptApi.createReceipt` handles both Firebase Storage upload and Firestore saving needs to be confirmed by analyzing the `receipts.js` service file.
- The use of `handleFirebaseError` in the catch block is likely incorrect, as errors from OCR or file validation are not Firebase errors. A more general error handling utility or specific error handling for different error sources is needed.
- The `validateDocument` helper function adds an extra layer of indirection but doesn't add significant logic beyond calling `validateFile` and showing a toast. Its necessity could be reviewed.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement actual cancellation support within the `performOcr` function (if Tesseract.js workers can be terminated) and the `receiptApi.createReceipt` function (for Firebase Storage uploads, using AbortController). Integrate this with the hook's `cancelProcessing` function.
- Update the `performOcr` and `receiptApi.createReceipt` functions to accept and actively use progress callback functions, and modify the hook's `processingStatus.progress` to update dynamically based on these callbacks for accurate progress reporting.
- Implement the logic for extracting structured receipt data (merchant, date, total, line items, etc.) from the `ocrResult.text` within the `processDocument` function or a dedicated utility function, and include this structured data in the `receiptData` object saved to Firestore.
- Analyze the `client/src/features/receipts/services/receipts.js` file to confirm that `receiptApi.createReceipt` correctly handles both Firebase Storage upload and Firestore saving.
- Refine the error handling in the catch block. Replace `handleFirebaseError` with a more general error processing utility or implement specific error handling for different potential error sources (validation, OCR, upload, Firestore save) to provide more accurate user feedback.
- Implement image preprocessing if it's deemed necessary for improving OCR accuracy.
- Consider if the `validateDocument` helper is necessary or if `validateFile` can be called directly within `processDocument`.

## üìÑ File: useOCR.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a custom React hook specifically for processing receipts using OCR. It appears to be a simpler hook that delegates the actual processing to the `documentProcessingService`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `useOCR`: A functional React hook.
- Uses `useState` for managing `loading` (boolean) and `error` (string or null) states.
- Imports `processDocument` from `documentProcessingService`.
- Imports `validateFile` utility (imported but not used in the provided snippet).
- Exports the `processReceipt` asynchronous function.
- Returns `loading`, `error`, and `processReceipt`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The hook exposes a single asynchronous function, `processReceipt`, which takes a `file` and a `userId`. When called, it sets the internal `loading` state to true, resets the `error` state, and then calls the `processDocument` function from the imported `documentProcessingService` with the provided `file` and `userId`. After the `processDocument` call completes (either successfully or with an error), the `loading` state is set back to false. A basic `try...catch` block is used to catch any errors thrown by `documentProcessingService.processDocument`, set the hook's `error` state with the error's message, and re-throw the original error.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- This hook appears to have a very similar purpose to `useDocumentProcessing.js` (both handle document/receipt processing and manage loading/error states). The distinction between these two hooks and why both are needed is unclear. This could lead to confusion and potential code duplication or inconsistency in how document processing is handled throughout the application.
- The `validateFile` utility is imported but is not used within the provided snippet of `useOCR.js`. File validation is a crucial step before attempting OCR or further processing, and it should ideally be performed within this hook's `processReceipt` function if this hook is intended to be the entry point for OCR processing.
- Error handling is very basic. It simply catches any error, sets the hook's `error` state with the error's message, and re-throws the original error. It does not use a centralized error handling utility (like `handleFirebaseError` used elsewhere) and doesn't provide specific user-friendly messages based on the type of processing error.
- The `userId` parameter is passed to `documentProcessingService.processDocument`. Depending on the implementation of `documentProcessingService.processDocument` and the overall application architecture, passing the `userId` explicitly here might be unnecessary or could potentially be handled more securely within the service or a higher-level context (like the authenticated user context).

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Clarify the intended purpose and scope of `useOCR.js` relative to `useDocumentProcessing.js`. Determine if both hooks are necessary and, if so, define their distinct responsibilities clearly. Consider refactoring or combining them if their functionality significantly overlaps.
- If `useOCR.js` is kept as the primary hook for initiating OCR processing, ensure that robust file validation using the imported `validateFile` utility is performed within the `processReceipt` function before calling `documentProcessingService.processDocument`.
- Improve error handling within the `processReceipt` function. Implement more specific error handling based on potential errors from `documentProcessingService.processDocument` and provide more user-friendly error messages, potentially by integrating with a centralized error handling utility.
- Review the implementation of `documentProcessingService.processDocument` and the overall data flow to determine if the `userId` parameter is truly necessary when called from this hook, or if user context should be managed differently.

## üìÑ File: documentProcessingService.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a service object (`documentProcessingService`) for handling document processing operations (upload, processing, text retrieval, classification) with a feature toggle mechanism to switch between Firebase direct integration and an API fallback. It encapsulates the logic for interacting with Firebase Storage, Firestore, and potentially Cloud Functions, as well as the original backend API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `documentProcessingService`: An object exporting functions: `preprocessImage`, `uploadDocument`, `processDocument`, `getDocumentText`, `classifyDocument`, and the API fallback functions (`uploadDocumentApi`, `processDocumentApi`, `getDocumentTextApi`, `classifyDocumentApi`).
- Imports `axios` (for API calls), Firebase Storage functions (`ref`, `uploadBytes`, `getDownloadURL`), Firestore functions (`collection`, `addDoc`, `doc`, `getDoc`), Firebase instances (`db`, `storage`, `auth`), `isFeatureEnabled` utility (for feature toggling), `handleFirebaseError` utility (for error handling and logging), and `processImage` utility (for image preprocessing).
- Defines `API_URL` (from `api.config`), `FIREBASE_DIRECT_INTEGRATION_FLAG` constant, and `getCurrentUserId` helper function.
- Includes implementations for API fallback functions (mostly placeholders).
- Includes feature-toggled implementations for primary functions (`uploadDocument`, `processDocument`, `getDocumentText`, `classifyDocument`) that attempt Firebase operations first and fall back to API calls on failure or if the feature flag is disabled.

### üß† Logic Overview
This service acts as a central point for document processing, abstracting the underlying implementation details (Firebase vs. API). The `uploadDocument` function handles file uploads. If the `firebaseDirectIntegration` feature flag is enabled, it attempts to upload the file to Firebase Storage under a user-specific path and saves the file metadata (including the download URL) to a 'documents' collection in Firestore. If the Firebase upload or Firestore save fails, or if the feature flag is disabled, it falls back to calling the `uploadDocumentApi` function. The `processDocument`, `getDocumentText`, and `classifyDocument` functions are designed to similarly use Firebase (likely Cloud Functions and Firestore retrieval) when the feature flag is enabled, falling back to their respective API functions. The `getCurrentUserId` helper ensures operations are associated with the authenticated user. The `handleFirebaseError` utility is used to process errors from both Firebase and API calls, providing centralized logging and potentially triggering automatic feature flag disabling.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The `processDocument`, `getDocumentText`, and `classifyDocument` functions are currently incomplete placeholders. They log messages indicating intended Firebase operations (Cloud Function calls, Firestore retrieval) but do not contain the actual implementation code. They either return dummy data or log warnings before falling back to the API placeholders. This means the core document processing logic (OCR, classification) is not yet implemented in the Firebase direct integration path within this service.
- Progress tracking for Firebase Storage uploads is not implemented in the `uploadBytes` function used in `uploadDocument`. The service does not provide a mechanism to report the upload progress to the caller.
- The `processImage` utility is imported but is not used in the provided snippet of `documentProcessingService.js`. Its intended role in the document processing workflow (e.g., before upload or before client-side OCR) is unclear.
- The API fallback functions (`processDocumentApi`, `getDocumentTextApi`, `classifyDocumentApi`) are also placeholders, returning dummy data or throwing generic errors. This means the API fallback is not functional for these steps.
- The `getCurrentUserId` helper throws a generic `handleFirebaseError` with a hardcoded 'User not authenticated' message if `auth.currentUser` is null. While defensive, more specific error handling or reliance on protected routes might be preferable.
- The error handling within the feature-toggled functions uses `handleFirebaseError` for both Firebase and API errors. This utility might be designed primarily for Firebase errors, and using it for potentially different API error structures might lead to incorrect or uninformative error processing.
- The logic for handling the results of the API fallback calls in the primary functions (e.g., what happens after `return uploadDocumentApi(...)`) is not fully detailed, although the `uploadDocument` function does return the result of the API call.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement the actual Firebase integration logic in the `processDocument`, `getDocumentText`, and `classifyDocument` functions. This includes making calls to Firebase Cloud Functions (if used for processing) and retrieving processed data (like extracted text and classification results) from Firestore.
- Implement progress tracking for Firebase Storage uploads in the `uploadDocument` function. This might involve using `uploadBytesResumable` and providing a callback to report progress. The service should then expose this progress information to its callers (e.g., via a callback parameter in `uploadDocument`).
- Clarify the role and implementation status of the `processImage` utility. If it's intended to be part of the processing flow, integrate it into the relevant service functions (e.g., before upload or before client-side OCR).
- Implement the actual API calls and error handling in the API fallback functions (`processDocumentApi`, `getDocumentTextApi`, `classifyDocumentApi`) if the API is intended to be a functional fallback. Alternatively, remove these placeholders if the API fallback is no longer necessary.
- Refine the error handling within the feature-toggled functions. Use specific error handling logic or a more general error processing utility that can correctly handle and provide informative messages for errors originating from both Firebase operations and API calls.
- Review the `getCurrentUserId` helper's error handling and consider if throwing a generic error is the best approach or if user authentication should be strictly enforced by route protection.

## üìÑ File: ocr.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides functions related to Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for receipts, including image optimization, uploading to Firebase Storage, calling a backend API for OCR processing, parsing the OCR response, validating the parsed data, and extracting specific information like the total amount.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports functions: `processReceiptImage`, `validateOCRResult`, `extractTotalFromText`.
- Imports Firebase Storage instance (`storage`), `formatCurrency` utility (not used), and `logger` utility.
- Includes internal helper functions: `uploadImage`, `optimizeImage`, `calculateDimensions`, `parseOCRResponse`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `processReceiptImage` function orchestrates the OCR process for a given file. It first attempts to optimize the image using the `optimizeImage` helper. Then, it uploads the (potentially optimized) image to Firebase Storage using the internal `uploadImage` function and retrieves the download URL. It then makes a POST request to the backend API endpoint `/api/receipts/process`, sending the image URL in the request body. Upon receiving a response, it parses the API's OCR result using `parseOCRResponse`. The `optimizeImage` function uses a canvas to resize and compress images that exceed a certain size, returning a new File object. `calculateDimensions` is a helper for `optimizeImage`. `parseOCRResponse` attempts to extract structured data (merchant, date, total, items) from the raw OCR text provided in the API response using regular expressions and basic heuristics. `validateOCRResult` checks if the key extracted fields (merchant, date, total, items) are present. `extractTotalFromText` is a utility to specifically find and parse the total amount from a given text string. Error handling is included in most functions, logging the error and re-throwing it, often with a generic message.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Inconsistency with Client-Side OCR Goal:** The most significant issue is that `processReceiptImage` makes a call to a backend API (`/api/receipts/process`) for OCR processing. This directly contradicts the stated goal in `useDocumentScanner.js` and the file's own header comments about using client-side Tesseract.js for OCR. This indicates either outdated code, a misunderstanding of the current architecture, or an incomplete refactoring.
- **Outdated Firebase Storage API:** The `uploadImage` function uses the old Firebase Storage API syntax (`storage().ref(...)`) instead of the current v9 modular syntax (`ref(storage, ...)`).
- **Basic Error Handling:** Error handling is present but lacks granularity. It often catches errors and throws a new generic error message ("Failed to process receipt", "Failed to optimize image", etc.) without preserving or providing details about the original error. More specific error handling based on the stage (optimization, upload, API call, parsing) and the nature of the error would be more helpful for debugging and user feedback.
- **Fragile Parsing Logic:** The `parseOCRResponse` function relies on simple regular expressions and heuristics to extract data from the raw OCR text. This approach is prone to errors and may fail to accurately extract information from receipts with varying layouts, fonts, or quality.
- **Unused Import:** The `formatCurrency` utility is imported but not used in the provided snippet.
- **Limited Validation:** The `validateOCRResult` function only checks for the *presence* of extracted fields (merchant, date, total, items) but does not validate the *plausibility* or *format* of the extracted data (e.g., checking if the date is valid, if the total is a reasonable number, if item prices sum up correctly).

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- **Resolve OCR Implementation:** Decide definitively whether OCR is performed client-side (e.g., with Tesseract.js) or via a backend API.
    - If client-side: Remove the API call in `processReceiptImage` and integrate the client-side OCR logic (e.g., using Tesseract.js, potentially in a separate utility or service function called from here).
    - If backend: Update the documentation and related components (`useDocumentScanner`, `documentProcessingService`) to accurately reflect that OCR is a backend process.
- **Update Firebase Storage API:** Refactor the `uploadImage` function to use the Firebase Storage v9 modular syntax (`ref`, `uploadBytes`, `getDownloadURL`).
- **Improve Error Handling:** Implement more specific error handling within each function (`optimizeImage`, `uploadImage`, the OCR call, `parseOCRResponse`). Catch specific error types or check error properties and throw more informative error messages that indicate *what* failed and *why*. Consider integrating with a centralized error handling utility.
- **Enhance Parsing Logic:** Improve the robustness of the `parseOCRResponse` function. This might involve using more sophisticated text processing techniques, leveraging libraries designed for receipt parsing, or potentially using a machine learning model if available.
- **Clean up Imports:** Remove the unused `formatCurrency` import.
- **Strengthen Validation:** Enhance the `validateOCRResult` function to include checks for data plausibility and format, providing more specific validation error messages.

## üìÑ File: visionService.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a service object (`visionService`) for processing receipt images using a backend Vision API to extract text. It includes image processing and uploading to Firebase Storage before calling the API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `visionService`: An object exporting the asynchronous function `processReceipt`.
- Imports Firebase Storage instance (`storage`) and `processImage` utility.
- Interacts with a backend API endpoint: `/api/vision/detect-text`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `processReceipt` function in this service takes a file as input. It first calls the `processImage` utility to potentially optimize or process the image. Then, it uploads the processed image to Firebase Storage, generating a unique filename based on the current timestamp and original filename. After a successful upload, it retrieves the download URL for the stored image. Finally, it makes a POST request to the backend API endpoint `/api/vision/detect-text`, sending the Firebase Storage image URL in the request body. It expects the API to return a JSON response containing the extracted `text`, the `imageUrl`, a `confidence` score, and an array of `items`. The function returns an object containing these results. Basic error handling is included in a `try...catch` block to log any errors that occur during the process and throw a generic error message ("Failed to process receipt image").

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Outdated Firebase Storage API:** The `storage.ref(filename)` syntax used for creating a storage reference is from an older version of the Firebase Storage SDK (v8 or earlier). It should be updated to use the current v9 modular syntax (`ref(storage, filename)`).
- **Basic Error Handling:** Error handling is present but lacks specificity. It catches any error, logs a generic message to the console, and throws a new generic error ("Failed to process receipt image"). It does not provide detailed information about *what* went wrong (e.g., image processing failed, upload failed, API call failed, API returned an error).
- **Unknown `processImage` Implementation:** The `processImage` utility is imported and used, but its implementation is not visible in this file. Without analyzing `processImage`, it's difficult to understand what processing steps are performed on the image before upload and if there are any potential issues or limitations with that utility.
- **Assumed API Response Structure:** The function assumes the exact structure of the JSON response from the `/api/vision/detect-text` endpoint (expecting `text`, `imageUrl`, `confidence`, and `items`). Any deviation in the actual API response structure would lead to errors.
- **Functional Overlap:** This service's core function (`processReceipt`) overlaps significantly with the purpose of `ocr.js` (which also handles image processing, upload, and text extraction via an API call) and `documentProcessingService.js` (which orchestrates a broader document processing flow). The existence of multiple services with similar responsibilities can lead to confusion, redundancy, and difficulty in maintaining a consistent document processing workflow.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- **Update Firebase Storage API:** Refactor the Firebase Storage upload logic within `processReceipt` to use the v9 modular syntax (`ref`, `uploadBytes`, `getDownloadURL`) for consistency with other parts of the application and to leverage the latest SDK features.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to be more specific. Catch errors at different stages (image processing, upload, API call) and provide more informative error messages that indicate the specific failure point. Consider integrating with a centralized error handling utility if available.
- **Analyze `processImage`:** Analyze the implementation of the `processImage` utility (located in `../utils/imageProcessing.js`) to understand its functionality and ensure it meets the requirements for image processing before sending to the Vision API.
- **Verify API Contract:** Confirm the exact JSON response structure returned by the `/api/vision/detect-text` endpoint and ensure the `processReceipt` function correctly handles and extracts data from it.
- **Consolidate Document Processing Logic:** Review the roles of `visionService.js`, `ocr.js`, and `documentProcessingService.js`. Consolidate the document processing logic into a single, well-defined service or set of utilities with clear responsibilities to avoid functional overlap and improve maintainability. If the Vision API is the primary method for OCR, integrate this logic into the main document processing flow managed by `documentProcessingService`.

## üìÑ File: documentClassifier.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a utility function (`classifyDocument`) for classifying a document as a 'receipt', 'invoice', or 'generic' based on the presence of specific keywords in its extracted text.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports function: `classifyDocument`.
- Takes `text` (string) as input.
- Uses simple string `includes` checks and converts text to lowercase.
- Defines basic keyword lists for 'receipt' and 'invoice'.
- Returns an object with `classification` (string) and `confidence` (number).

### üß† Logic Overview
The `classifyDocument` function determines the type of a document based on its textual content. It first checks if the input `text` is empty, returning a 'generic' classification with low confidence if it is. Otherwise, it converts the text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching. It then checks for the presence of predefined keywords commonly associated with receipts (e.g., "receipt", "total", "cashier") and invoices (e.g., "invoice", "bill to", "due date"). Based on which keywords are found, it assigns a `classification` of 'receipt', 'invoice', or 'generic'. A simple `confidence` score is calculated, starting at a base value and increasing if keywords for a specific classification are found. If keywords for both receipt and invoice are present, the current logic is basic and doesn't have a sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism, potentially defaulting based on the order of checks or remaining 'generic'. The calculated confidence is clamped between 0 and 1.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Basic and Fragile Algorithm:** The classification algorithm is very simple and relies solely on the presence of a limited set of keywords. This approach is highly susceptible to errors and misclassifications. Documents with variations in terminology, formatting, language, or those containing keywords from multiple categories (e.g., an invoice with "total" or a receipt with "bill to") can easily be misclassified.
- **Simplistic Confidence Score:** The confidence score calculation is rudimentary and does not accurately reflect the true likelihood of the classification being correct. It's a simple increment based on keyword matches, which is not a robust measure of confidence.
- **Lack of Conflict Resolution:** The logic for handling cases where keywords for both 'receipt' and 'invoice' are present is not sophisticated. It doesn't have a clear strategy for determining the most likely document type in such ambiguous cases.
- **No Handling for Variations:** The algorithm does not account for synonyms, misspellings, or grammatical variations of keywords, which can lead to missed classifications.
- **Limited Scope:** The classifier only distinguishes between 'receipt', 'invoice', and 'generic'. It cannot classify other types of documents that might be processed by the application.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- **Adopt More Sophisticated Techniques:** Replace the simple keyword matching with more advanced text analysis techniques. This could involve using natural language processing (NLP) libraries to understand the context of words, analyze sentence structure, or identify key entities.
- **Machine Learning Model:** For significantly improved accuracy, consider training a machine learning model for document classification using a dataset of labeled receipts, invoices, and other document types.
- **Expand Keyword Set and Use Fuzzy Matching:** If sticking with a keyword-based approach, significantly expand the list of keywords and phrases for each document type. Implement fuzzy matching or stemming to handle variations and misspellings.
- **Refine Confidence Calculation:** Develop a more meaningful confidence score calculation, potentially based on the number and specificity of matched keywords, the distribution of keywords throughout the text, or the output probabilities from an NLP model or machine learning classifier.
- **Implement Robust Conflict Resolution:** Define and implement a clear strategy for resolving classification conflicts when keywords for multiple document types are present. This might involve weighting keywords, considering the overall structure of the text, or using a tie-breaking mechanism.
- **Expand Document Type Support:** If necessary, extend the classifier to identify other relevant document types beyond receipts and invoices.

## üìÑ File: imageProcessing.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a utility function (`processImage`) for performing basic image processing operations on a file, including resizing, rotation, and zooming, using a canvas.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports asynchronous function: `processImage`.
- Takes `file` (File object) and optional `options` (object with `rotation` and `zoom`) as input.
- Uses HTMLCanvasElement and its 2D rendering context.
- Uses `createImageBitmap` to load the image.
- Applies canvas transformations: `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`.
- Draws the image onto the canvas.
- Converts canvas content to a JPEG Blob and then to a File object.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `processImage` function takes an image `file` and applies basic transformations based on the provided `options`. It loads the image into an `ImageBitmap` for efficient drawing. It calculates the target dimensions for the canvas, ensuring the image is scaled down if wider than 1920px and applying the `zoom` factor. It adjusts canvas dimensions to accommodate rotation if the rotation is not a multiple of 180 degrees. It then creates a canvas element, gets its 2D context, and applies transformations (translation to center, rotation, and scaling) to the context. The image is drawn onto the transformed canvas. Finally, the content of the canvas is converted into a JPEG Blob with a quality of 0.9, which is then wrapped in a new `File` object with the original filename and a current timestamp. The function returns a Promise that resolves with this new processed image file. Basic error handling is included to catch errors during the process and throw a generic "Failed to process image" error.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **DOM Dependency:** The implementation relies on creating and manipulating HTMLCanvasElement and HTMLImageElement (implicitly via `createImageBitmap` which is tied to the DOM environment). This makes the utility unsuitable for environments without a DOM, such as Node.js or certain types of web workers.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Error handling is rudimentary. It catches any error during the process, logs a generic message to the console, and throws a new generic error. It doesn't provide specific details about *what* failed (e.g., image loading failed, canvas operation failed).
- **Scaling Logic Ambiguity:** The scaling logic (`scaleFactor < 1 ? scaleFactor : 1`) seems to prioritize scaling down to `maxWidth` but doesn't explicitly handle scaling up if the original image is smaller than `maxWidth`. The `zoom` factor is applied on top of this, which might lead to unexpected final dimensions or scaling behavior depending on the initial image size.
- **Fixed Output Format and Quality:** The function is hardcoded to output a JPEG file with a quality of 0.9. It does not allow the caller to specify the desired output format (e.g., PNG, WebP) or compression quality.
- **Potential Performance for Large Images:** While `createImageBitmap` is generally efficient, processing very large images on the main thread using a canvas can still potentially impact performance and cause jank.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- **Decouple from DOM:** If the utility needs to be used in non-DOM environments, consider refactoring it to use a headless canvas library or an image processing library that can operate in memory or web workers.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to be more specific. Catch errors at different stages (image loading, canvas operations) and provide more informative error messages that indicate the specific failure point.
- **Refine Scaling and Zoom:** Review and refine the scaling and zoom logic to be more explicit and flexible. Allow the caller to specify desired output dimensions or scaling behavior (e.g., "fit within", "cover", "scale to percentage") and ensure the `zoom` factor is applied predictably.
- **Allow Output Customization:** Modify the function to accept parameters for the desired output image format (MIME type) and compression quality.
- **Consider Web Workers:** For processing very large images, consider offloading the image processing logic to a web worker to avoid blocking the main thread and improve application responsiveness.
