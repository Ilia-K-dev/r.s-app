## üìÑ File: useReceipts.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a custom React hook for fetching receipts and uploading new receipts, integrating with a shared `receiptApi` service.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports the `useReceipts` functional hook.
- Imports `useGetReceiptsQuery` and `useUploadReceiptMutation` from `../../../shared/services/receiptApi`.
- Takes optional `page` (number) and `limit` (number) parameters for fetching.
- Returns `receipts` (array), `hasMore` (boolean), `isLoading` (boolean for fetching), `error` (string or null), `uploadReceipt` (mutation function), and `isUploading` (boolean for upload loading state).

### üß† Logic Overview
The `useReceipts` hook leverages functions from a shared `receiptApi` service (presumably built with a data fetching library like RTK Query or similar). It uses `useGetReceiptsQuery` to fetch a list of receipts, accepting optional `page` and `limit` parameters for pagination. It exposes the fetched `data` (aliased to `receipts` and `hasMore`), loading state (`isLoading`), and error state (`error`) from this query. It also uses `useUploadReceiptMutation` to get a function (`uploadReceipt`) to upload new receipts and exposes the loading state for this mutation (`isUploading`). The hook acts as a simple wrapper around these shared service functions, providing a convenient interface for components to interact with receipt data and upload functionality.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The hook is tightly coupled to the specific implementation details of `../../../shared/services/receiptApi` (specifically the names and expected behavior of `useGetReceiptsQuery` and `useUploadReceiptMutation`). Changes in the shared service would directly impact this hook.
- Error handling is basic, relying on the `error` state provided by the query hook. More specific error handling or user feedback might be needed depending on the types of errors the `receiptApi` can return.
- The hook doesn't include any local state management for the list of receipts beyond what's returned by the query. Adding, updating, or deleting receipts would require refetching the query or manually updating the cache/state in the shared service layer.
- The hook assumes the structure of the data returned by `useGetReceiptsQuery` (having `receipts` and `hasMore` properties).

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Ensure the `../../../shared/services/receiptApi` is well-defined and stable, as this hook depends heavily on its interface.
- Consider adding more specific error handling or mapping generic errors from the `receiptApi` to more user-friendly messages if needed.
- If local state updates (optimistic or otherwise) are desired after mutations (add, update, delete), these would need to be implemented in the shared `receiptApi` service using cache invalidation or updates, or handled manually in components using the mutation functions provided by this hook.
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript to define the expected structure of the data returned by the shared service and the hook's return value.
