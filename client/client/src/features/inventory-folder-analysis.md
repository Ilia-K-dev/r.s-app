## üìÑ File: InventoryItem.js

### üîç Purpose
This component represents a single item in the inventory list, displaying its name, quantity, and unit, and providing controls to adjust the quantity, edit the item, or delete it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Functional component `InventoryItem` that accepts `item` (object with id, name, quantity, unit), `onUpdate`, `onDelete`, and `onEdit` props.
- Uses `useState` for managing the item's quantity locally (although it immediately calls `onUpdate`, suggesting the state might be lifted).
- Uses `handleQuantityChange` function to increment or decrement the quantity.
- Renders item details and buttons for quantity adjustment, edit, and delete.
- Uses icons from `lucide-react`.
- Imports `Button`, `Input`, and `Card` shared components.

### üß† Logic Overview
The component displays the details of an inventory item. It provides buttons to easily increase or decrease the item's quantity by one. It also includes an input field to manually set the quantity. When the quantity is changed (either via buttons or input), it calls the `onUpdate` prop with the updated item object. It conditionally renders Edit and Delete buttons based on whether `onEdit` and `onDelete` props are provided, calling the respective handlers when clicked.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The component uses `useState` for `item.quantity` but immediately calls `onUpdate` which likely updates the parent's state. This local state might be unnecessary and could be removed, directly using the `item.quantity` prop and calling `onUpdate` in the handlers.
- The input field for quantity uses `parseInt` with a fallback to 0, which is reasonable, but could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if non-numeric input is briefly present before parsing.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Remove the local `useState` for quantity and directly use the `item.quantity` prop.
- Ensure robust input handling for the quantity input field, potentially adding more validation or feedback for invalid input.

## üìÑ File: InventoryList.js

### üîç Purpose
This component displays a list of inventory items, typically in a table format, and includes basic pagination controls. It fetches inventory data using a custom hook.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Functional component `InventoryList`.
- Uses `useInventory` hook to fetch inventory data, loading/error states, and pagination information.
- Defines `columns` for the `Table` component, including a custom render function for the 'Status' column.
- Implements `handleNextPage` function to update pagination state for fetching the next page.
- Includes a placeholder/comment for `handlePreviousPage`, noting the complexity with cursor-based pagination.
- Renders `Alert` for errors, `Table` to display inventory data, and `Button` for pagination controls.
- Imports `Alert`, `Card`, `Table`, and `Button` shared components.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `InventoryList` component retrieves inventory data and its loading/error status from the `useInventory` hook. It defines how the inventory data should be displayed in a table, including a visual indicator for low stock items. It renders the table and displays an alert if there's an error. It also provides a "Next Page" button that, when clicked, updates the pagination state in the `useInventory` hook to fetch the next set of data using a cursor-based approach. The "Previous Page" functionality is noted as complex and not fully implemented.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Incomplete Pagination:** The "Previous Page" functionality is not implemented due to the complexity of cursor-based pagination. This limits the user's ability to navigate back through the inventory list.
- **Tight Coupling with `useInventory`:** The component is tightly coupled with the `useInventory` hook, directly accessing its state and pagination functions. While common for hooks within their feature, it means this component cannot easily be used with a different data fetching mechanism.
- **Basic Error Display:** Errors are displayed using a generic `Alert`. More specific error messages or handling might be beneficial.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement full pagination support, including the "Previous Page" functionality. This would likely require modifying the `useInventory` hook to manage a history of cursors or using a different pagination strategy.
- Consider making the data fetching mechanism more abstract if there's a need to reuse this component with different data sources in the future.
- Enhance error display to provide more informative messages to the user.

## üìÑ File: StockAlerts.js

### üîç Purpose
This component displays alerts for inventory items that are running low on stock based on their defined reorder point.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Functional component `StockAlerts`.
- Uses `useInventory` hook to fetch inventory data, loading/error states.
- Filters inventory items to identify those with quantity at or below their `reorderPoint`.
- Renders a `Card` containing a list of `Alert` components for each low stock item.
- Imports `Alert` and `Card` shared components.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `StockAlerts` component retrieves the full inventory list from the `useInventory` hook. It filters this list to find items whose current `quantity` is less than or equal to their `reorderPoint`. If any low stock items are found, it renders a card with a "Low Stock Alerts" heading and displays a warning `Alert` for each low stock item, indicating the item name and current quantity. It shows a loading message while data is being fetched and an error alert if fetching fails. If there are no low stock items, it renders nothing.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Dependency on `useInventory`:** Tightly coupled with the `useInventory` hook for data fetching.
- **Filtering Logic:** The filtering logic is directly within the component. For more complex filtering or if the inventory list is very large, this could potentially impact performance.
- **Basic Alert Message:** The alert message is generic. It could potentially include more details like the reorder point or suggestions for action.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- If performance becomes an issue with a large inventory, consider moving the low stock filtering logic into the `useInventory` hook or a selector to avoid re-calculating on every render.
- Enhance the alert message to provide more context or actionable information.

## üìÑ File: StockManager.js

### üîç Purpose
This component provides a form for adding new inventory items to the stock.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Functional component `StockManager`.
- Uses `useInventory` hook to access the `addItem` function.
- Uses `useState` to manage the state of the `newItem` form input fields (name, quantity, unit, minStock).
- Uses `useState` to manage local error messages.
- Implements `handleSubmit` function to handle form submission.
- Renders a `Card` containing a form with `Input` fields for item details and a submit `Button`.
- Imports `Button`, `Input`, `Alert`, and `Card` shared components.
- Uses icons from `lucide-react`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `StockManager` component renders a form that allows users to input details for a new inventory item. It uses local state to keep track of the values entered in the input fields. When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function is called. This function prevents the default form submission, calls the `addItem` function from the `useInventory` hook with the new item data, resets the form fields on success, and sets a local error state if adding the item fails. An `Alert` component is used to display any submission errors.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Input Validation:** Basic HTML `required` attribute is used, but more robust client-side validation (e.g., ensuring quantity and minStock are valid numbers) is not explicitly implemented in the component's logic.
- **Error Handling:** Error handling is basic, simply displaying the error message from the caught exception. More user-friendly error messages or specific feedback for different types of errors might be beneficial.
- **Tight Coupling with `useInventory`:** Directly calls `addItem` from the `useInventory` hook.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement more comprehensive client-side validation for the form inputs, providing specific feedback to the user for invalid data.
- Enhance error handling to provide more user-friendly messages or handle different error scenarios more gracefully.

## üìÑ File: useInventory.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a React hook for managing inventory-related operations. It encapsulates the state and logic for interacting with the inventory service, offering functions for loading, creating, retrieving, updating, deleting inventory items, and managing stock levels and movements.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- `useInventory`: The main custom React hook.
- State variables: `inventoryItems`, `currentItem`, `stockMovements`, `loading`, `error`, `filters`.
- Memoized callback functions: `clearError`, `loadInventory`, `getItem`, `createItem`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`, `updateStock`, `loadStockMovements`, `getLowStockItems`.
- Imports `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect` from 'react', `useAuth` from '../../auth/hooks/useAuth', and `inventoryService` from '../services/inventoryService'.

### üß† Logic Overview
The hook manages the state related to inventory operations. It uses `useAuth` to get the current user. It provides functions to interact with the `inventoryService` for CRUD operations on inventory items and managing stock. It updates the internal state (`inventoryItems`, `currentItem`, `stockMovements`, loading/error flags, `filters`) based on the results of these service calls. The `loadInventory` function supports merging or replacing filters. An `useEffect` hook loads inventory when the user changes.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Filter Management:** The filter merging logic in `loadInventory` is a bit manual (`mergedFilters.resetFilters ? { ...newFilters } : { ...filters, ...newFilters }`). While functional, a more standardized approach to filter management might be beneficial if filter complexity increases.
- **Error Handling:** Error handling is basic (setting an error message string). More structured error objects or a dedicated error handling context might be beneficial.
- **State Updates:** State updates for `inventoryItems` and `currentItem` after create, update, and delete operations directly modify the state arrays/objects. For larger applications or more complex state interactions, using an immutable update pattern or a state management library might be safer and more predictable.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- **Refine Filter Management:** Consider a more robust filter management pattern, potentially using a reducer or a dedicated filter state hook if the filtering logic becomes more complex.
- **Refine Error Handling:** Refine error handling to provide more context about the error type.
- **Immutable State Updates:** Adopt a pattern for immutable state updates to prevent accidental direct modification of state objects/arrays.
- **Add PropTypes or TypeScript:** Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety.

## üìÑ File: inventoryService.js

### üîç Purpose
Provides a service layer for managing inventory data, abstracting interactions with the data source (Firestore or a backend API). It includes functions for CRUD operations on inventory items, updating stock quantities, and retrieving stock movement history.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exported asynchronous functions: `createInventoryItem`, `updateInventoryItem`, `getInventoryItem`, `getUserInventory`, `deleteInventoryItem`, `updateStockQuantity`, `getStockMovements`.
- Imports Firestore functions (`collection`, `doc`, `addDoc`, `updateDoc`, `getDoc`, `getDocs`, `query`, `where`, `deleteDoc`, `increment`, `serverTimestamp`).
- Imports `db` from `../../../core/config/firebase`.
- Imports `isFeatureEnabled` from `../../../core/config/featureFlags`.
- Imports `handleFirestoreError` from `../../../utils/errorHandler`.
- Imports `api` from `../../../shared/services/api`.

### üß† Logic Overview
Each function checks if the `inventoryDirectIntegration` feature flag is enabled.
- If enabled, it interacts directly with Firestore for inventory operations (adding, updating, retrieving, deleting items in the 'inventory' collection, updating stock using `increment`, and adding records to a 'stockMovements' collection). It uses `serverTimestamp()` for timestamp fields.
- If the feature flag is *not* enabled, it falls back to making API calls using the imported `api` service for the respective operations.
- Error handling is included using the imported `handleFirestoreError` utility.
- `getUserInventory` includes client-side filtering for search and low stock when using Firebase direct integration, as Firestore has limitations on these types of queries.
- `updateStockQuantity` prevents negative stock unless explicitly allowed and creates a record in the 'stockMovements' collection.
- `getStockMovements` retrieves movements for an item and sorts them client-side by timestamp.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- **Client-Side Filtering:** Performing search and low stock filtering client-side in `getUserInventory` can be inefficient for large datasets.
- **Stock Movement Sorting:** Sorting stock movements client-side in `getStockMovements` can also be inefficient for a large number of movements. Firestore queries can include `orderBy`, which would be more efficient.
- **Feature Flag Logic:** Similar to the document service, the feature flag logic is implemented within each function. A more centralized approach could improve maintainability.
- **Error Handling Detail:** The level of detail and user-friendliness of the errors returned depends on the `handleFirestoreError` utility.
- **Stock Movement Schema:** The schema for the 'stockMovements' collection is assumed but not explicitly defined or enforced here.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Improve Filtering/Searching:** For better performance with large datasets, consider alternative approaches for search (e.g., a dedicated search service, denormalized data for basic prefix matching) and low stock filtering (e.g., a scheduled job to identify low stock items).
- **Firestore Sorting:** Use Firestore's `orderBy` in the `getStockMovements` query for more efficient server-side sorting.
- **Refactor Feature Flag Logic:** Consider refactoring the service to use a factory pattern or similar approach to switch between Firebase and API implementations based on the feature flag.
- **Review Error Handling Utility:** Examine the `handleFirestoreError` utility to ensure it provides sufficient detail and user-friendly messages.
- **Define Stock Movement Schema:** Clearly define and potentially enforce the schema for the 'stockMovements' collection.
- **Add Input Validation:** Add input validation to ensure required parameters are provided and have the expected format.
