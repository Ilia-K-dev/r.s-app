This document provides a detailed file-level analysis of the `client/src/hooks/` directory, which contains custom React hooks used across the application.

## üìÑ File: src/hooks/useRTL.js

### üîç Purpose
A custom React hook that determines if the current language is Right-to-Left (RTL) and manages the document's text direction and language attributes accordingly. It also provides a function to toggle between English (LTR) and Hebrew (RTL).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Imports `useTranslation` from `react-i18next`.
- Imports `useEffect` from `react`.
- Defines the custom hook `useRTL`.
- Uses `useTranslation` to get the `i18n` instance (which contains the current language).
- Calculates `isRTL` based on whether the current language (`i18n.language`) is 'he' (Hebrew).
- Uses `useEffect` to update the `dir` and `lang` attributes of the `document.documentElement` whenever `isRTL` or `i18n.language` changes.
- Returns an object containing `isRTL` (boolean) and `toggleDirection` (a function to switch language between English and Hebrew).

### üß† Logic Overview
The `useRTL` hook integrates with the `react-i18next` library to react to language changes. It determines if the current language is Hebrew, which is an RTL language. A `useEffect` hook is used to apply the appropriate `dir` attribute ('rtl' or 'ltr') and `lang` attribute to the root HTML element (`<html>`). This ensures that the entire document layout and text direction are correctly set based on the selected language. The hook also provides a `toggleDirection` function that simplifies switching between English and Hebrew by calling `i18n.changeLanguage`.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The hook currently only supports toggling between English ('en') and Hebrew ('he'). If the application needs to support other RTL or LTR languages, the `toggleDirection` logic would need to be expanded or made more dynamic.
- The logic assumes that 'he' is the only RTL language and all other languages are LTR. This might not be true if support for other languages is added. A more robust approach would be to have a configuration or mapping of languages to their directionality.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for the hook's return type or the expected structure of the `i18n` object (though it comes from a library).

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for the hook's return value.
- If supporting more languages, create a configuration or utility function that maps language codes to directionality ('ltr' or 'rtl') and use that mapping in the hook.
- Consider making the languages to toggle between configurable if needed.
- Document the dependency on `react-i18next` and the assumption that 'he' is the RTL language.
