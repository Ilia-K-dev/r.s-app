## 📄 File: src/shared/components/charts/ChartComponent.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This file likely serves as a wrapper or base component for rendering different types of charts using a charting library. It aims to provide a reusable interface for displaying data visually.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React` and potentially a charting library (like Chart.js, Recharts, etc. - need to confirm the actual import).
- Defines a functional component `ChartComponent`.
- Accepts props to configure the chart (e.g., `data`, `options`, `type`).

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component takes data and configuration options as props and uses the imported charting library to render a chart within its container. It abstracts away the direct interaction with the charting library's API for consumers.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The specific charting library used is not immediately clear from the file name or the provided context.
- Lack of prop type validation or TypeScript types.
- Error handling for invalid data or options might be missing.
- Accessibility considerations for charts (e.g., providing alternative text or data tables) might be overlooked.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Clearly identify and document the charting library being used.
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for props.
- Implement basic error handling for rendering issues.
- Explore adding accessibility features for chart consumers.
- Consider if this component is flexible enough for all required chart types or if more specific chart components are needed.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/charts/chartHelpers.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This file likely contains utility functions that support the chart components, such as data transformation, formatting, or configuration generation for the charting library.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports various helper functions related to chart data manipulation or configuration.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
These functions take raw data or configuration inputs and process them into a format suitable for the charting library used by `ChartComponent` or other chart-related components.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The specific functions and their purposes are not detailed without reading the file content.
- Lack of input validation or type checking in helper functions.
- Potential for tight coupling with the specific charting library.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Read the file content to understand the specific helper functions and their logic.
- Add JSDoc or TypeScript types for function parameters and return values.
- Implement input validation to ensure functions handle unexpected data gracefully.
- Assess if any helpers could be more generic or if they are too tightly coupled to the charting library.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/layout/Layout.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A core layout component that provides a consistent structure for application pages, likely including the Navbar, Footer, and a content area.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React`, `Navbar`, `Footer`, and potentially other layout-related components.
- Defines a functional component `Layout`.
- Accepts `children` prop to render page-specific content within the layout structure.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
Renders the `Navbar`, the `Footer`, and a main content area where the `children` (the page content) are displayed. Manages the overall page structure and potentially applies global layout styles.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- Styling is likely embedded using Tailwind classes.
- No explicit prop type validation for `children`.
- Might not be flexible enough to support different layout variations if needed for specific pages.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for `children`.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- If different layouts are required, explore using context or props to conditionally render different structures or components.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/layout/Navbar.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable React component for rendering the application's navigation bar.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React`, and potentially routing hooks (`useNavigate`, `useLocation`) or components (`Link`) from a routing library (like React Router).
- Defines a functional component `Navbar`.
- Renders navigation links, potentially a logo, and other header elements.

### 🧠 Logic Overview

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- Navigation links are likely hardcoded, making it difficult to update or manage routes centrally.
- Styling is likely embedded using Tailwind classes.
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes for navigation) might be missing.
- No explicit prop type validation.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Manage navigation links centrally (e.g., in a config file or context) and pass them as props.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- Add comprehensive accessibility features for navigation.
- Implement `PropTypes` or TypeScript types.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/Loading.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A simple reusable React component for displaying a visual loading spinner.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React`.
- `LoadingProps`: JSDoc typedef for component props (`size`).
- `Loading({ size })`: Functional component that renders a container `div` and an animated spinner `div`.
  - `size`: String, determines the size of the spinner ('sm', 'md', 'lg'). Defaults to 'md'.
- `sizes`: An object mapping size names to Tailwind CSS classes for height and width.
- Renders a container `div` with flexbox classes to center the spinner.
- Renders an inner `div` that is styled as a circular spinner with a partial border, and the `animate-spin` Tailwind class provides the rotation animation.
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (flex layout, centering, animation, rounded shape, border, border color).
- Exports `Loading` as a named export and as the default export.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component renders a basic spinner animation using CSS. The outer `div` centers the spinner horizontally and vertically. The inner `div` is styled to be a circle with a partial border, and the `animate-spin` Tailwind class provides the rotation animation. The size of the spinner is controlled by applying dynamic height and width classes from the `sizes` object based on the `size` prop.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- No explicit prop type validation (e.g., using `PropTypes` or TypeScript).
- The JSDoc typedef and `@desc` are present, which is good, but consistent and comprehensive JSDoc across all components would be beneficial.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes.
- There are no accessibility attributes (like `aria-live` or `role="status"`) to indicate to screen readers that content is loading.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for the component's props.
- Ensure consistent JSDoc documentation for all shared components.
- Add accessibility attributes to properly convey the loading state to assistive technologies.
- Consider how styling will be managed across the design system as it evolves.
- Potentially add support for different spinner styles or colors if needed.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/Modal.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable React component for displaying a modal dialog window.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `X` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Imports `PropTypes` from `prop-types`.
- Imports `React`.
- Defines a functional component `Modal`.
- Accepts props: `isOpen` (boolean, required), `onClose` (function, required), `title` (string), `children` (React node), `size` (string, 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', defaults to 'md').
- Defines `sizes` object mapping size names to Tailwind CSS classes for `max-w`.
- Uses `PropTypes` for prop validation.
- Defines `defaultProps` for `size`.
- Renders a fixed overlay and a centered modal container.
- Includes a close button with an `X` icon.
- Renders the `title` and `children` within the modal content area.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component conditionally renders the modal based on the `isOpen` prop. When open, it displays a fixed overlay that covers the screen and a centered modal dialog. Clicking the overlay or the close button triggers the `onClose` function. The modal's size is controlled by the `size` prop, which applies corresponding Tailwind `max-w` classes. It includes basic accessibility attributes for the close buttons.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The background overlay click handler includes `onKeyDown` for 'Enter', which might not be standard or expected behavior for an overlay.
- While some accessibility attributes are present (`aria-label`), more comprehensive ARIA roles and states could be added for better screen reader support (e.g., `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`).
- Focus management: When the modal opens, focus should ideally be trapped within the modal, and when it closes, focus should return to the element that triggered the modal. This is not implemented.
- Closing with the 'Escape' key is a common and expected behavior for modals but is not implemented.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement proper focus trapping within the modal when it's open.
- Add support for closing the modal using the 'Escape' key.
- Enhance accessibility with appropriate ARIA roles and states (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`).
- Review the `onKeyDown` handler on the overlay and consider if it's necessary or standard behavior.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- Ensure the modal is truly modal and prevents interaction with the content behind it (the overlay helps with this visually, but focus management is key for accessibility).

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/PerformanceOptimizedList.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A performance-optimized list component that uses virtualization to efficiently render large lists. It only renders the items that are currently visible in the viewport, plus a few extra (overscan). Requires a fixed item height.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React`, `useCallback`, `useState`.
- Imports `FixedSizeList` as `VirtualizedList` from `react-window`.
- Imports `AutoSizer` from `react-virtualized-auto-sizer`.
- `PerformanceOptimizedListProps`: JSDoc typedef for component props (`data`, `renderItem`, `itemHeight`, `overscanCount`).
- `generateUniqueId`: Simple helper function to create unique IDs.
- Defines the functional component `PerformanceOptimizedList`.
- Accepts props: `data` (array, defaults to empty), `renderItem` (function, required), `itemHeight` (number, defaults to 50), `overscanCount` (number, defaults to 5).
- Uses `React.useMemo` to generate a unique ID for the list instance.
- Defines a memoized `Row` component using `useCallback` for rendering individual items, receiving `index` and `style` props from `react-window`.
- Includes a conditional render for an empty `data` array.
- Renders a container `div` with height and width set to 100%.
- Uses `AutoSizer` to get the dimensions of the container.
- Renders `VirtualizedList` with `height`, `itemCount`, `itemSize`, `width`, and `overscanCount` props.
- Passes the `Row` component as the render function to `VirtualizedList`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component leverages `react-window` and `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` to implement list virtualization. `AutoSizer` ensures the list fills its parent container and provides its dimensions. `VirtualizedList` then uses these dimensions, along with the provided `itemHeight`, `itemCount` (from `data.length`), and `overscanCount`, to calculate which items are currently visible and should be rendered. The `Row` component, created using `useCallback` for performance, is responsible for rendering the content of each individual item using the provided `renderItem` function and applying the necessary `style` prop for positioning. A message is displayed if the data array is empty.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `generateUniqueId` function is a simple implementation and might not be robust enough for all use cases (though acceptable for this specific component's need for a unique list ID).
- The component assumes a fixed item height (`itemHeight`). It cannot handle lists with variable item heights without significant modifications or using a different virtualization library/approach (like `react-window`'s `VariableSizeList`).
- No explicit prop type validation for the `renderItem` function's signature or the structure of items within the `data` array (though JSDoc is present).
- Error handling for invalid `renderItem` function or non-array `data` is not explicit.
- The outer container `div` has inline styles (`height: '100%', width: '100%'`), which might be better managed via CSS classes or a styling system.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for all props, including a more specific type for the `renderItem` function and the expected structure of `data` items.
- Consider adding support for variable item heights if the application requires it in other lists.
- Add basic error handling for invalid prop types or data structures.
- Manage the container styling using CSS classes.
- Ensure the `renderItem` function provided by the consumer is performant, as it will be called frequently during scrolling. Document this requirement clearly.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/SearchBar.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable Search Bar component with debouncing. Allows users to type a search query, and the `onSearch` callback is triggered after a delay.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `Search` and `X` icons from `lucide-react`.
- Imports `React` and `useState`.
- `SearchBarProps`: JSDoc typedef for component props (`onSearch`, `placeholder`, `debounceMs`).
- Defines the functional component `SearchBar`.
- Accepts props: `onSearch` (function, required), `placeholder` (string, defaults to 'Search...'), `debounceMs` (number, defaults to 300).
- Uses `useState` to manage the input `query`.
- `handleSearch`: Function to update the query state and debounce the `onSearch` callback using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`. Stores the timeout ID on the function itself.
- Uses `React.useEffect` for cleanup to clear any pending timeout when the component unmounts.
- Renders a container `div` with relative positioning.
- Includes a `Search` icon positioned absolutely on the left.
- Renders an `<input>` element for text input.
- Conditionally renders a clear button with an `X` icon on the right if the `query` is not empty.
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component maintains the current input value in the `query` state. The `handleSearch` function is called on input change. It updates the `query` state immediately but delays calling the `onSearch` prop using `setTimeout`. If the user types again before the delay is over, the previous timeout is cleared, and a new one is set (debouncing). This prevents the `onSearch` callback from being called on every keystroke, improving performance for operations like filtering or API calls. A clear button is shown when there's text in the input, allowing the user to quickly clear the query. A `useEffect` hook ensures that any pending timeout is cleared when the component is unmounted.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- Storing the `timeoutId` directly on the `handleSearch` function is an unconventional pattern. While it works, it's less common than using a `useRef` hook for managing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders.
- No explicit prop type validation for the `onSearch` function or other props (though JSDoc is present).
- Accessibility: The clear button (`X` icon) should have an `aria-label` for screen readers to indicate its purpose (e.g., "Clear search query"). This is missing.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Use the `useRef` hook to store and manage the `timeoutId` instead of attaching it to the `handleSearch` function. This is a more standard React pattern.
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for all props, including the `onSearch` function.
- Add an `aria-label` to the clear button for accessibility.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- Ensure the input field has appropriate accessibility attributes if it's linked to search results or suggestions (though this component is just the input).

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/Table.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable Table UI component for displaying tabular data. Supports defining columns, providing data, and optional row click handling.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React`.
- `TableColumn`: JSDoc typedef for column definitions (`key`, `header`, `render`).
- `TableProps`: JSDoc typedef for component props (`columns`, `data`, `onRowClick`).
- Defines the functional component `Table`.
- Accepts props: `columns` (array of `TableColumn`, required), `data` (array of objects, required), `onRowClick` (function, optional).
- Renders a container `div` with `overflow-x-auto` for horizontal scrolling.
- Renders a `<table>` element with basic Tailwind classes for styling.
- Renders the table header (`<thead>`) by mapping over the `columns` array to create `<th>` elements.
- Renders the table body (`<tbody>`) by mapping over the `data` array to create `<tr>` elements for each row.
- Each row includes an optional `onClick` handler if `onRowClick` is provided, and applies hover styling.
- Renders table data cells (`<td>`) by mapping over the `columns` array for each row.
- Cell content is determined by either the `render` function provided in the column definition or by accessing the value from the `row` object using the `column.key`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The `Table` component takes column definitions and data as input. It iterates through the `columns` array to render the table header row. Then, it iterates through the `data` array to render each table row. For each cell in a row, it checks if a custom `render` function is provided in the column definition. If so, it uses the `render` function to generate the cell's content, passing the current row data. Otherwise, it accesses the value from the row object using the column's `key`. An optional `onRowClick` function can be provided to make rows clickable, executing the function with the row data when clicked and applying a hover effect.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- No explicit prop type validation (e.g., using `PropTypes` or TypeScript) for the structure of `columns` or `data` (though JSDoc is present).
- Accessibility: The table lacks proper ARIA attributes for semantic meaning and relationships (e.g., `scope` on `<th>`, potentially `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` if needed for complex tables). Keyboard navigation within the table might also need consideration if it's interactive beyond row clicks.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes, which might limit flexibility for complex table designs or themes.
- The component does not handle sorting, pagination, or filtering internally. These features would need to be implemented by the parent component managing the `data` and `columns`.
- Using array index as `key` for both columns and rows is generally discouraged, especially if the lists can be reordered or filtered, as it can lead to performance issues and incorrect component updates. Unique IDs from the data should be used if available.
- The component does not handle an empty `data` array gracefully; it will render an empty table body.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for `columns` (defining the shape of `TableColumn`) and `data`.
- Enhance accessibility by adding appropriate ARIA attributes and ensuring keyboard navigability if needed.
- Use unique IDs from the `data` objects as `key` props for rows if available. For columns, a stable identifier or a generated unique ID (if no stable key exists) would be better than the index.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- Document that sorting, pagination, and filtering are responsibilities of the parent component.
- Add an empty state message or component to display when the `data` array is empty.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/Tabs.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable Tabs UI component for displaying content in tabbed sections. Allows switching between different content panels by clicking on tab headers.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React` and `useState`.
- `Tab`: JSDoc typedef for individual tab objects (`label`, `content`).
- `TabsProps`: JSDoc typedef for component props (`tabs`, `onTabChange`, `initialTab`).
- Defines the functional component `Tabs`.
- Accepts props: `tabs` (array of `Tab`, required), `onTabChange` (function, optional), `initialTab` (number, defaults to 0).
- Uses `useState` to manage the `activeTab` index.
- `handleTabClick`: Function to update the `activeTab` state and call the optional `onTabChange` callback.
- Renders a container `div`.
- Renders a navigation area (`<nav>`) with `aria-label="Tabs"`.
- Maps over the `tabs` array to render each tab header as a `<button>`.
- Applies dynamic Tailwind classes to highlight the active tab header.
- Renders the `content` of the currently `activeTab` below the tab headers.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The `Tabs` component manages which tab is currently active using the `activeTab` state, initialized by the `initialTab` prop. It renders a list of tab headers based on the `tabs` array. When a tab header button is clicked, the `handleTabClick` function updates the `activeTab` state to the index of the clicked tab and calls the optional `onTabChange` callback. The component then renders the `content` associated with the `activeTab` from the `tabs` array. Styling is applied dynamically to visually indicate the active tab header.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- No explicit prop type validation (e.g., using `PropTypes` or TypeScript) for the structure of `tabs` (defining the shape of `Tab`) or other props (though JSDoc is present).
- Accessibility: While the `nav` element has an `aria-label`, more comprehensive ARIA roles and states are needed for proper tab component accessibility (e.g., `role="tablist"` on the container of tab headers, `role="tab"` on each tab button, `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` attributes on tab buttons, `role="tabpanel"` and `aria-labelledby` on the content panel). Keyboard navigation (arrow keys to switch tabs) is also a standard accessibility feature for tab components and is not implemented.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes.
- The component assumes that the `tabs` array is not empty and that `initialTab` is a valid index. Error handling for invalid inputs is missing.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add `PropTypes` or TypeScript types for all props, including the structure of the `tabs` array and the `onTabChange` function.
- Implement comprehensive accessibility features, including ARIA roles, states, and keyboard navigation.
- Add basic error handling for an empty `tabs` array or an invalid `initialTab` index.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach.
- Document the expected structure of the `tabs` array clearly.

## 📄 File: src/shared/components/ui/Tooltip.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A reusable Tooltip UI component that displays a small informational box when the user hovers over its child element.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `React` and `useState`.
- Defines the functional component `Tooltip`.
- Accepts props: `content` (React node, required), `position` (string, 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right', defaults to 'top'), `children` (React node, required), `delay` (number, defaults to 0), `className` (string, defaults to '').
- Uses `useState` to manage `isVisible` state (boolean) and `timeoutId` state (number or null).
- `showTooltip`: Function to set a timeout to make the tooltip visible after a delay.
- `hideTooltip`: Function to clear the timeout (if any) and hide the tooltip.
- `positions`: Object mapping position names to Tailwind CSS classes for absolute positioning.
- Renders a container `div` with relative positioning and `inline-block` display.
- Attaches `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` event handlers to the container to show/hide the tooltip.
- Renders the `children` element.
- Conditionally renders the tooltip content `div` based on the `isVisible` state.
- Applies absolute positioning and dynamic classes based on the `position` prop and additional `className`.
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (background, text color, padding, rounded corners, shadow, whitespace).

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The `Tooltip` component wraps a child element (`children`). It uses `useState` to track whether the tooltip should be visible and to store the ID of the timeout used for the display delay. When the user hovers over the container (`onMouseEnter`), the `showTooltip` function sets a timeout to make the tooltip visible after the specified `delay`. When the user stops hovering (`onMouseLeave`), the `hideTooltip` function clears any pending timeout and hides the tooltip immediately. The tooltip content (`content`) is rendered absolutely positioned relative to the container, with its position determined by the `position` prop which maps to predefined Tailwind classes.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- No explicit prop type validation (e.g., using `PropTypes` or TypeScript) for the props (though JSDoc is present).
- Accessibility: Tooltips triggered only by hover are not accessible to keyboard-only users or screen reader users. A truly accessible tooltip should be focusable and appear on focus as well as hover, and have appropriate ARIA attributes (`role="tooltip"`, `aria-describedby` on the trigger element). This component lacks these.
- Styling is directly embedded using Tailwind classes.
- The component does not handle potential overflow issues if the tooltip content is too wide or positioned near the edge of the viewport.
- The `timeoutId` state is managed using `useState`, which is less conventional for mutable values like timeout IDs compared to `useRef`.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement comprehensive accessibility features, including keyboard focus support and ARIA attributes.
- Use the `useRef` hook to store and manage the `timeoutId` instead of `useState`.

## 📄 File: src/shared/hooks/useLocalStorage.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A custom React hook for managing state that is persisted to and synchronized with the browser's `localStorage`.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `useState` and `useEffect` from `react`.
- Imports `logger` from `../utils/logger`.
- Defines the custom hook `useLocalStorage`.
- Accepts parameters: `key` (string, the localStorage key) and `initialValue` (any, the default value if nothing is in localStorage).
- Uses `useState` with a function to initialize the state by attempting to read from `localStorage`. Includes error handling and logging for the initial read.
- Uses `useEffect` to add and remove a `storage` event listener to synchronize state across tabs/windows. Includes error handling and logging for parsing incoming values.
- Returns an array containing the `storedValue`, a `setValue` function (wrapped setter that also writes to localStorage), and a `removeValue` function (removes from state and localStorage).

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The hook initializes its state by trying to read the value associated with the provided `key` from `localStorage`. If successful, it parses the JSON string; otherwise, it uses the `initialValue`. It includes error handling during the initial read. A `useEffect` hook sets up a `storage` event listener. This listener fires when `localStorage` is changed in another tab or window with the same origin. If the change is for the hook's `key`, it updates the hook's state to synchronize the value. The hook returns the current value, a setter function (`setValue`) that updates both the hook's state and `localStorage`, and a `removeValue` function to clear the value from both state and `localStorage`. Both `setValue` and `removeValue` include error handling for `localStorage` operations.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using `PropTypes` or TypeScript) for the `key` or `initialValue` parameters, or the return types (though JSDoc is present).
- The hook assumes the value stored in `localStorage` is always valid JSON. If non-JSON data is stored under the same key by other means, parsing will fail.
- Error handling primarily logs to the console. Depending on the application's error reporting strategy, more robust handling might be needed.
- The `useEffect` dependency array includes `storedValue`, which could potentially lead to unnecessary re-runs if the stored value is a complex object that changes frequently, although the comparison `storedValue !== newValue` helps mitigate this for primitive types.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for better type safety.
- Consider adding more sophisticated error handling or allowing consumers to provide custom error handlers.
- Review the `useEffect` dependency array and consider if `storedValue` is strictly necessary or if there's a more optimized way to handle synchronization.
- Document the assumption that stored values are JSON strings.

## 📄 File: src/shared/hooks/useToast.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A custom React hook that provides a convenient way for components to access and trigger toast notifications using the `ToastContext`.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `useContext` from `react`.
- Imports `ToastContext` from `../../core/contexts/ToastContext`.
- Defines the custom hook `useToast`.
- Uses `useContext` to get the current value of `ToastContext`.
- Checks if the context value is null/undefined and throws an error if the hook is used outside of a `ToastProvider`.
- Returns the context value (which should contain functions to show toasts).

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This hook is a simple wrapper around `useContext`. It consumes the `ToastContext` and provides the context value to any component that calls `useToast`. It includes a crucial check to ensure that the hook is only used within a component tree where `ToastContext` has been provided (typically by a `ToastProvider` component). If the context is not available, it throws a descriptive error, guiding developers to wrap their application or relevant part in the `ToastProvider`.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- This hook is tightly coupled to the specific implementation of `ToastContext` located at `../../core/contexts/ToastContext`. If the context file is moved or renamed, this hook will break.
- The error message is helpful but could potentially include more context, although for this specific error, it's quite clear.
- No explicit type validation or TypeScript types for the expected shape of the context value returned by `useContext`.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types to define the expected shape of the `ToastContext` value.
- Ensure the `ToastContext` file is located in a stable, well-known location within the project structure to minimize issues with the import path.
- Document the dependency on `ToastProvider` clearly wherever `useToast` is used or documented.

## 📄 File: src/shared/services/api.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides a centralized Axios instance configured for making API calls to the backend, including request and response interceptors for authentication and error handling.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `axios`.
- Imports `auth` from Firebase config.
- Imports `logger` from `./logger`.
- Imports `API_CONFIG` from `../../core/config/api.config`.
- Creates an `axios` instance named `api` with `baseURL` and `timeout` from `API_CONFIG`.
- Configures a request interceptor to:
    - Get the current Firebase user's ID token.
    - Attach the token as an `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`).
    - Log the request details in development mode using the imported `logger`.
- Configures a response interceptor to:
    - Log successful response details in development mode.
    - Handle 401 Unauthorized errors by attempting to refresh the Firebase token and retrying the original request.
    - Extract a user-friendly error message from the response or use a default message.
    - Log the full error details in development mode.
    - Reject the promise with a new `Error` object containing the user-friendly message and the original error attached.
- Exports `receiptApi`, `categoryApi`, `inventoryApi`, and `exportApi` objects, each containing methods for specific API endpoints (e.g., `uploadReceipt`, `getCategories`, `getInventory`, `generateExport`). These methods use the configured `api` instance.
- Exports the configured `api` instance as the default export.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file sets up a core `axios` instance (`api`) for all backend communication, using configuration from `api.config.js`. It implements two key interceptors:
1.  **Request Interceptor:** Automatically fetches the current user's Firebase ID token before each request and adds it to the `Authorization` header. This ensures that authenticated requests are handled seamlessly. It also logs request details in development.
2.  **Response Interceptor:** Handles responses and errors. For successful responses, it logs details in development. For errors, it specifically checks for 401 Unauthorized errors. If a 401 occurs and it's not a retry attempt, it forces a Firebase token refresh. If the refresh is successful, it updates the original request's header with the new token and retries the request. If token refresh fails or the error is not a 401, it extracts a user-friendly error message, logs the error details, and rejects the promise with a client-side `Error` object.
The file also defines and exports separate objects (`receiptApi`, `categoryApi`, `inventoryApi`, `exportApi`) that group API methods by domain, making the API surface cleaner for consumers. These methods simply call the appropriate `api` instance methods (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) with the correct endpoints and data, and rethrow any errors caught by the interceptor.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The token refresh logic within the response interceptor is a common pattern but can be complex to get right, especially regarding race conditions if multiple requests fail with 401 simultaneously. The current implementation marks the original request with `_retry`, which helps prevent infinite loops but doesn't fully address potential race conditions where multiple requests might try to refresh the token at once.
- The error handling in the response interceptor creates a new `Error` object and attaches the original error. While this provides a user-friendly message, consumers need to know to look for `originalError` if they need more detailed error information (e.g., status code).
- The logging within the interceptors is conditional on `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`. This is good, but the `logger` itself should also handle different log levels based on the environment.
- The `receiptApi.createReceipt` and `receiptApi.updateReceipt` methods handle `multipart/form-data` for file uploads. This is necessary but adds complexity to these specific methods compared to standard JSON requests.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for the parameters or return types of the API methods (though JSDoc is present).

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Consider using a library or a more robust pattern for handling token refresh and potential race conditions in Axios interceptors.
- Clearly document the structure of the error object rejected by the response interceptor, including the presence of `originalError`.
- Ensure the `logger` utility handles different log levels based on the environment (e.g., only log errors in production).
- Add TypeScript types for all API method parameters and return types for better type safety and developer experience.
- Evaluate if the API methods should return the full response object or just the `response.data`. The current implementation returns `response.data` for most, but `deleteReceipt` is commented as potentially returning `response.status`. Consistency is key.

## 📄 File: src/shared/services/logger.js

### 🔍 Purpose
A simple client-side logger utility for logging messages to the browser console with different severity levels.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Defines a `logger` object with methods: `info`, `error`, `debug`, and `warn`.
- `info`: Logs messages using `console.log` with an "[INFO]" prefix.
- `error`: Logs messages using `console.error` with an "[ERROR]" prefix.
- `debug`: Logs messages using `console.debug` with a "[DEBUG]" prefix, but only if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is 'development'.
- `warn`: Logs messages using `console.warn` with a "[WARN]" prefix.
- Each method accepts a message string and optional additional data to log.
- Exports the `logger` object as the default export.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The `logger` object provides a standardized interface for logging messages within the client-side application. It wraps the standard browser `console` methods (`log`, `error`, `debug`, `warn`) and prepends a severity level tag ([INFO], [ERROR], [DEBUG], [WARN]) to each message for easier identification in the console. The `debug` method is conditionally enabled based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, ensuring debug messages are not shown in production builds. Optional additional data can be passed to the logging methods and will be logged alongside the message.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- This is a very basic logger. It lacks features commonly found in more robust logging libraries, such as:
    - Configurable log levels (e.g., setting a minimum level like WARN to only see warnings and errors).
    - Different output formats (e.g., JSON, plain text).
    - Integration with remote logging services for error tracking in production.
    - Contextual logging (e.g., automatically including user ID, request ID, or component name).
- The conditional logging for `debug` is hardcoded based on `NODE_ENV`. More flexible environment-based configuration could be beneficial.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for the message or data parameters.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Consider replacing this simple logger with a more feature-rich logging library if advanced logging capabilities are needed.
- If sticking with this custom logger, consider adding a configuration option to set the minimum log level.
- Explore integrating with a remote error tracking service (like Sentry, LogRocket) for production error monitoring.
- Add TypeScript types for the logger methods.

## 📄 File: src/shared/services/receiptApi.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This file appears to contain placeholder or mock implementations for React Query hooks related to receipt API operations (`useGetReceiptsQuery`, `useUploadReceiptMutation`). It does not contain the actual logic for making API calls.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `useGetReceiptsQuery`: A function that returns a mock object with `data`, `isLoading`, and `error` properties.
- Exports `useUploadReceiptMutation`: A function that returns a mock array containing a mock mutation function and an object with `isLoading` and `error` properties.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The functions in this file are simple mocks. `useGetReceiptsQuery` simulates the return value of a data fetching hook, providing empty data, `isLoading: false`, and `error: null`. `useUploadReceiptMutation` simulates a mutation hook, returning a mock function that resolves immediately with empty data and a state object indicating not loading and no error. These mocks are likely used for testing or initial component development before the actual API integration is complete.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- This file contains mock implementations, not the actual API service logic for receipts. The real API calls (likely using the `api` instance from `api.js`) are missing.
- The naming convention (`use...Query`, `use...Mutation`) suggests an intention to use a data fetching library like React Query or Apollo Client, but the actual implementation is just returning static mock data.
- The mock data is very basic and does not represent the actual structure of receipt data.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Replace the mock implementations with actual logic that uses the configured `api` instance (from `api.js`) to make real API calls for fetching and uploading receipts.
- Integrate with a data fetching library like React Query or Apollo Client as suggested by the hook naming convention.
- Define proper types (e.g., using TypeScript) for the expected data structures for receipts, filters, and mutation variables.
- Remove this file once the actual API integration is complete, or rename it clearly as a mock file if it's intended for specific testing scenarios.

## 📄 File: src/shared/services/storage.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides utility functions for interacting with Firebase Storage for file uploads, downloads, and deletions, as well as simple local and session storage caching mechanisms.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports Firebase Storage functions (`ref`, `uploadBytes`, `getDownloadURL`, `deleteObject`) from `firebase/storage`.
- Imports the Firebase `storage` instance from `../../core/config/firebase`.
- Imports `logger` from `../utils/logger`.
- `uploadFile`: Async function to upload a file to a specified path in Firebase Storage. Generates a unique filename using a timestamp. Returns file metadata including URL and path on success. Includes error handling and logging.
- `uploadImage`: Async function specifically for uploading image files. Validates file type and calls `uploadFile` with a user-specific path. Includes error handling and logging.
- `deleteFile`: Async function to delete a file from Firebase Storage using its path. Includes error handling and logging.
- `getFileUrl`: Async function to get the download URL for a file in Firebase Storage using its path. Includes error handling and logging.
- `generateThumbnail`: Async function to generate a JPEG thumbnail from an image file using the browser's Canvas API. Returns a new `File` object for the thumbnail. Includes error handling and logging.
- `localCache`: Object with methods (`set`, `get`, `remove`, `clear`) for interacting with `localStorage`. Stores data with an expiration time (TTL). Includes error handling and logging.
- `sessionStorage`: Object with methods (`set`, `get`, `remove`, `clear`) for interacting with `sessionStorage`. Stores data for the duration of the session. Includes error handling and logging.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file centralizes various storage-related operations. The Firebase Storage functions (`uploadFile`, `uploadImage`, `deleteFile`, `getFileUrl`) provide an interface for interacting with cloud storage, handling file references, uploads, downloads, and deletions. `uploadFile` creates a unique name for uploaded files using a timestamp and the original filename. `uploadImage` adds basic image type validation and uses a user-specific path. `generateThumbnail` provides client-side image processing to create smaller thumbnail versions. Additionally, the file includes simple wrappers around browser `localStorage` (`localCache`) and `sessionStorage` (`sessionStorage`) for client-side data caching. `localCache` includes a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism to automatically expire cached data. All functions include basic try-catch blocks with logging for error handling.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `generateThumbnail` function relies on the browser's Canvas API, which is suitable for client-side processing but might not be performant for very large images or in environments without a DOM. Server-side thumbnail generation might be more robust.
- The `localCache` implementation's TTL is based on client-side time, which can be manipulated by the user. For sensitive data or strict expiration requirements, a server-side solution is necessary.
- Error handling in the cache utilities primarily logs errors but doesn't provide a way for consumers to react to cache read/write failures.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- The `uploadImage` function hardcodes the storage path prefix (`receipts/${userId}`). This might need to be more configurable if images for other purposes are stored.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and objects.
- Consider implementing server-side thumbnail generation for better performance and reliability.
- Document the limitations of client-side TTL for `localCache`.
- Provide options for consumers of `localCache` and `sessionStorage` to handle errors (e.g., by returning a result object with an error property or allowing custom error callbacks).
- Make the storage paths in `uploadImage` and potentially `uploadFile` more configurable.

## 📄 File: src/shared/styles/index.css

### 🔍 Purpose
This file serves as the main entry point for the application's shared CSS styles, primarily utilizing Tailwind CSS directives and defining custom component and utility classes.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities using `@import` directives.
- Defines custom component classes within an `@layer components` block, such as:
    - `.card`: Styles for card containers.
    - `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-danger`: Styles for buttons with different variants.
    - `.input`, `.input-error`: Styles for form input fields and error states.
    - `.layout-container`, `.sidebar-link`, `.sidebar-link-active`: Styles for layout elements.
    - `.badge`, `.badge-success`, `.badge-warning`, `.badge-error`: Styles for badge components.
    - `.fade-enter`, `.fade-enter-active`, `.fade-exit`, `.fade-exit-active`: CSS classes for fade transitions.
    - `.progress-striped`, `.progress-animated`: CSS classes and keyframes for striped and animated progress bars.
    - `.custom-scrollbar`: Styles for a custom scrollbar appearance.
- Defines global base styles within an `@layer base` block, including:
    - `@keyframes progress-stripes`: Keyframes for the progress bar animation.
    - Body styles (`bg-gray-50`, `text-gray-900`, `antialiased`).
    - Heading styles (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`).
    - Link styles (`a`).
- Defines custom utility classes within an `@layer utilities` block, such as:
    - `.text-shadow`: A utility for adding text shadow.
    - `.scrollbar-hide`: A utility to hide the scrollbar.
- Includes a potentially redundant `@layer components` block at the end with a single rule.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This CSS file uses Tailwind's `@import` and `@layer` directives to organize styles. It imports the core Tailwind layers first. Then, within `@layer components`, it defines reusable CSS classes that compose multiple Tailwind utility classes to create distinct UI elements like cards, buttons, form inputs, and layout components. It also defines classes for animations and custom scrollbar styling. The `@layer base` block sets up global styles for the body, headings, and links, and defines the keyframes for the progress bar animation. A custom utility class for text shadow and a utility to hide scrollbars are defined in the `@layer utilities` block. The final `@layer components` block seems misplaced and contains only one rule, which might be an oversight.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The final `@layer components` block appears redundant and should likely be removed or merged with the main components block.
- While Tailwind is used, some components might still have inline styles or styles defined directly in their component files, leading to inconsistency.
- The custom scrollbar styling using `scrollbar-thin`, `scrollbar-thumb`, and `scrollbar-track` classes relies on a Tailwind plugin (`tailwind-scrollbar`) which is not explicitly mentioned but is implied by the class names. This dependency should be noted.
- The fade transition classes (`fade-enter`, etc.) suggest the use of a library like `react-transition-group`, which should be confirmed and documented.
- The use of magic strings for color classes (e.g., `primary-600`, `gray-50`) is inherent to Tailwind but means that changing the color palette requires updating these classes directly or relying heavily on Tailwind's configuration.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Remove the redundant `@layer components` block at the end of the file.
- Ensure consistent styling practices across all components, preferring the use of these shared CSS classes or Tailwind utilities over inline styles where appropriate.
- Document the dependency on the `tailwind-scrollbar` plugin and any other relevant Tailwind configurations.
- Document the usage of the fade transition classes and the library they are intended to be used with (e.g., `react-transition-group`).
- Consider defining custom CSS variables for colors or other design tokens if more dynamic theming or easier color updates are needed beyond Tailwind's configuration.

## 📄 File: src/shared/styles/tailwind.css

### 🔍 Purpose
This file is the main configuration and entry point for Tailwind CSS in the application. It imports Tailwind's core directives and defines custom CSS variables for colors and additional component/utility classes.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities using `@tailwind` directives.
- Defines custom CSS variables for primary, success, warning, error, and info colors within a `@layer base` block. These variables use RGB values.
- Defines custom component classes within an `@layer components` block, including:
    - `progress-striped`, `progress-animated`, and `@keyframes progress-stripes`: Styles and animation for progress bars.
    - `btn-base`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger`: Base and variant styles for buttons.
    - `form-input`, `form-label`, `form-error`: Styles for form elements.
    - `card`, `card-header`, `card-body`, `card-footer`: Styles for card components.
    - `alert`, `alert-success`, `alert-warning`, `alert-error`, `alert-info`: Base and variant styles for alert messages.
    - `badge`, `badge-success`, `badge-warning`, `badge-error`, `badge-info`: Base and variant styles for badges.
    - `modal-overlay`, `modal-container`, `modal-content`: Styles for modal structure.
    - `spinner`: Styles for a loading spinner.
- Defines custom utility classes within an `@layer utilities` block, including:
    - `scrollbar-hide`: Utility to hide scrollbars across different browsers.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file sets up Tailwind CSS by importing its core layers. It then extends Tailwind's capabilities by defining custom CSS variables for key colors in the `@layer base` block. These variables likely correspond to the color names used in the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) to allow for easier theming or color adjustments. Within the `@layer components` block, it defines a comprehensive set of reusable component classes (buttons, forms, cards, alerts, badges, modals, spinners) by composing Tailwind utility classes. This promotes consistency and reduces repetition in component markup. The `@layer utilities` block adds a custom utility for hiding scrollbars. The file effectively combines Tailwind's utility-first approach with a component-based structure using `@apply` directives.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The custom color variables defined in `@layer base` (`--color-primary`, etc.) might not be fully integrated with the Tailwind configuration. Ideally, these colors should be defined in `tailwind.config.js`'s `theme.extend.colors` to be usable directly as Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-primary`, `bg-success`). The current setup might require using arbitrary values or CSS variables directly in components, which is less idiomatic Tailwind.
- Some component classes defined here (e.g., `.card`, `.btn`) seem to overlap or be similar to classes defined in `index.css`. This could lead to confusion or unintended style overrides. A clear strategy for organizing shared styles between `index.css` and `tailwind.css` is needed.
- The `progress-striped` and `progress-animated` classes and keyframes are defined within `@layer components` in this file, but also seem to be referenced or defined in `index.css`. This duplication should be resolved.
- The `scrollbar-hide` utility is defined in both `index.css` and `tailwind.css`. This is redundant.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Consolidate color definitions into `tailwind.config.js` and use Tailwind's extended color palette directly in component classes.
- Establish a clear convention for where shared styles should live (e.g., all component classes in `index.css`, all utilities in `tailwind.css`, or vice versa) and remove duplicate definitions.
- Remove the duplicate `progress-striped`, `progress-animated`, `@keyframes progress-stripes`, and `scrollbar-hide` definitions.
- Document the purpose and intended usage of `index.css` and `tailwind.css` and how they relate to each other.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/cache.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides a simple in-memory cache utility using a JavaScript `Map`, with support for time-to-live (TTL) expiration.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Initializes a `Map` named `cache` to store cached data.
- `setCache`: Function to add or update an item in the cache. Takes a `key`, `value`, and optional `ttl` (milliseconds). Stores the value and an expiration timestamp if `ttl` is greater than 0.
- `getCache`: Function to retrieve an item from the cache by `key`. Checks if the item exists and if it has expired based on its `expiry` timestamp. Deletes expired items from the cache. Returns the cached value or `undefined`.
- `invalidateCache`: Function to remove a specific item from the cache by `key`.
- `clearCache`: Function to remove all items from the cache.
- Exports `setCache`, `getCache`, `invalidateCache`, and `clearCache`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This utility provides a basic in-memory caching mechanism. Data is stored in a `Map` where keys are strings and values are objects containing the cached data (`value`) and an optional expiration timestamp (`expiry`). When `setCache` is called with a `ttl`, it calculates the expiration time. `getCache` retrieves an item and checks if its expiration time has passed. If it has, the item is removed from the cache before returning `undefined`. `invalidateCache` and `clearCache` provide ways to explicitly remove individual items or clear the entire cache.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- This is an in-memory cache, meaning the cache is cleared whenever the application is reloaded or the browser tab is closed. It is not persistent.
- The TTL mechanism relies on client-side system time, which is not reliable and can be easily manipulated.
- There is no automatic cleanup process for expired items. Expired items are only removed when `getCache` is called for that specific key. For a large cache with many items and long TTLs, this could lead to memory growth.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- Error handling is missing (e.g., for invalid key types).

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for better type safety.
- Implement an automatic cleanup mechanism (e.g., using `setInterval` or a more sophisticated library) to periodically remove expired items from the cache.
- Document clearly that this is an in-memory cache and not persistent storage.
- For persistent caching needs, consider using `localStorage` (as implemented in `storage.js`) or IndexedDB.
- Add basic input validation and error handling.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/currency.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides utility functions for formatting, parsing, and converting currency values.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- `formatCurrency`: Formats a number as a currency string using `Intl.NumberFormat`. Accepts value, currency code (defaults to 'USD'), and locale (defaults to 'en-US'). Includes basic null/undefined check and error handling with a fallback.
- `parseCurrencyInput`: Parses a currency input string into a floating-point number. Attempts to remove non-numeric characters except decimal point and sign. Includes basic null/empty string check and error handling. Note: locale parameter is present but not used in the current parsing logic.
- `convertCurrency`: Converts an amount from one currency to another using provided exchange rates. Assumes exchange rates are relative to a base currency. Includes checks for missing exchange rates.
- `getCurrencySymbol`: Gets the currency symbol for a given currency code and locale using `Intl.NumberFormat`. Includes error handling with a '$' fallback.
- Exports all four functions.
- Exports a default object containing all four functions.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file centralizes currency-related operations. `formatCurrency` uses the browser's built-in `Intl.NumberFormat` API for robust and locale-aware currency formatting. `parseCurrencyInput` attempts to clean a string input by removing common currency symbols and separators to extract a numeric value, although the parsing logic is basic and might not handle all international formats correctly. `convertCurrency` performs simple currency conversion based on provided exchange rates, assuming a common base currency. `getCurrencySymbol` extracts the currency symbol using `Intl.NumberFormat`. Error handling in these functions primarily logs to the console and provides fallbacks.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `parseCurrencyInput` function's regex and logic are basic and may not correctly handle currency formats from all locales (e.g., locales using comma as a decimal separator, different thousand separators, or different currency symbol placements). The `locale` parameter is not used in the parsing logic.
- The `convertCurrency` function assumes a specific structure for `exchangeRates` (rates relative to a base currency) and does not handle more complex scenarios or fetching live exchange rates.
- Error handling primarily logs to the console. More robust error reporting or allowing consumers to handle errors might be needed.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Enhance `parseCurrencyInput` to be locale-aware and handle different decimal and thousand separators correctly, potentially using `Intl.NumberFormat`'s parsing capabilities or a dedicated library.
- Document the expected structure of the `exchangeRates` object for `convertCurrency`.
- Consider integrating with a real-time exchange rate API if dynamic currency conversion is required.
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.
- Improve error handling to provide more options for consumers.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/date.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides a collection of utility functions for working with dates and time using the `date-fns` library. Includes functions for formatting, parsing, comparing, calculating differences, generating ranges, and getting date parts.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports numerous functions from the `date-fns` library.
- `formatDate`: Formats a date (Date object or string) into a specified string format. Handles invalid dates.
- `isValidDate`: Checks if a value is a valid Date object.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file acts as a wrapper around the `date-fns` library, providing a set of commonly needed date utility functions. It leverages `date-fns` for core date manipulation and formatting logic, adding input validation (checking for valid dates and handling null/undefined inputs) and error handling (logging errors to the console). Functions cover a wide range of use cases, from simple formatting and parsing to more complex operations like calculating differences, generating date ranges, grouping dates, and determining fiscal periods. The `normalizeDate` function is particularly useful for handling various input types and formats.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- Error handling primarily logs to the console. Depending on the application's error reporting strategy, more robust handling might be needed.
- The `parseDate` and `normalizeDate` functions attempt to parse date strings using a predefined list of formats. This list might not be exhaustive and could fail for other valid date string formats. `normalizeDate`'s fallback to the `new Date()` constructor can be unreliable for parsing strings.
- The `formatDateDuration` function's calculation of remaining days after accounting for months is an approximation (`% 30`) and not precise.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- The `getFiscalPeriods` function assumes a standard 12-month year and fixed-length quarters based on the fiscal year start month. More complex fiscal calendars are not supported.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.
- Enhance error handling to provide more options for consumers.
- Improve the string parsing logic in `parseDate` and `normalizeDate` to be more robust, potentially using a dedicated date parsing library or a more comprehensive list of formats.
- Refine the `formatDateDuration` calculation for more accuracy if needed.
- Document the assumptions and limitations of functions like `getFiscalPeriods`.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides utility functions for file-related operations, including formatting file size, validating file type and size, creating and revoking file previews (Object URLs), and reading files as Data URLs.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `logger` from `./logger`.
- `formatFileSize`: Formats a file size in bytes into a human-readable string (e.g., "1.23 MB").
- `validateFileType`: Checks if a file's type is included in an array of allowed types.
- `getFileExtension`: Extracts the file extension from a filename.
- `createFilePreview`: Creates a temporary URL (Object URL) for a file, suitable for displaying previews (e.g., images). Includes error handling and logging.
- `revokeFilePreview`: Revokes a previously created Object URL to release memory.
- `validateFileSize`: Checks if a file's size is less than or equal to a maximum allowed size.
- `validateFile`: Performs comprehensive file validation based on provided options (max size, accepted types, min/max dimensions - note: dimension validation is commented out in the provided code but included in the JSDoc). Returns an object indicating validity and an array of error messages.
- `readFileAsDataUrl`: Reads a file's content as a Data URL using `FileReader`. Returns a Promise that resolves with the Data URL.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file offers a set of helper functions for common file handling tasks on the client-side. `formatFileSize` provides a user-friendly representation of file sizes. `validateFileType` and `validateFileSize` perform basic checks against predefined criteria. `createFilePreview` and `revokeFilePreview` are essential for efficiently displaying file previews without loading the entire file into memory, with error handling for creation. `readFileAsDataUrl` is useful for scenarios where the file content is needed as a Data URL (e.g., for image manipulation on a canvas). `validateFile` combines multiple validation checks into a single function for convenience.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The dimension validation logic (`minDimensions`, `maxDimensions`) is present in the JSDoc for `validateFile` but commented out in the actual code. This functionality is missing.
- Error handling primarily logs to the console. More robust error reporting or allowing consumers to handle errors might be needed.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- The `getFileExtension` logic might have edge cases with filenames containing multiple dots or starting with a dot.
- The `generateThumbnail` function, which is related to file processing, is located in `storage.js` instead of this file, which is specifically for file helpers. This inconsistency in organization should be addressed.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement the dimension validation logic in the `validateFile` function.
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.
- Improve error handling to provide more options for consumers.
- Refine the `getFileExtension` logic to handle edge cases more robustly.
- Move the `generateThumbnail` function from `storage.js` to this file (`fileHelpers.js`) to consolidate file-related utilities.
- Document the expected format of the `options` object for `validateFile`.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/formatters.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides simple utility functions for formatting common data types like currency, dates, and percentages.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- `formatCurrency`: Formats a number as a currency string using `Intl.NumberFormat`. Defaults to 'en-US' locale and 'USD' currency.
- `formatDate`: Formats a date into a string using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. Defaults to 'en-US' locale and 'MM/DD/YYYY' format (using 2-digit month/day and numeric year).
- `formatPercentage`: Formats a numeric value (assuming a decimal representation, e.g., 0.5 for 50%) as a percentage string with a specified number of decimal places.
- Exports all three functions.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file offers basic formatting utilities. `formatCurrency` and `formatDate` leverage the browser's `Intl` API for locale-aware formatting, although the `formatDate` implementation hardcodes a specific output format rather than using the provided `format` parameter as a format string for `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. `formatPercentage` performs a simple multiplication andtoFixed operation.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `formatDate` function's `format` parameter is misleading; it is not used as a format string for `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. The output format is fixed to 'MM/DD/YYYY'.
- The `formatCurrency` and `formatDate` functions hardcode the locale to 'en-US'. They do not accept a locale parameter, limiting internationalization capabilities.
- Error handling for invalid input values (e.g., non-numeric for currency/percentage, invalid date for date) is missing.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- There is a duplicate `formatCurrency` function defined in `src/shared/utils/currency.js`. This duplication should be resolved, and the more comprehensive version in `currency.js` should likely be kept.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Remove the duplicate `formatCurrency` function. Consolidate currency formatting in `src/shared/utils/currency.js`.
- Modify `formatDate` to correctly use the `format` parameter as a format string, potentially by switching to a library like `date-fns` (which is already used in `src/shared/utils/date.js`) or implementing more sophisticated `Intl.DateTimeFormat` options.
- Add a `locale` parameter to `formatCurrency` and `formatDate` to support internationalization.
- Add basic input validation and error handling to all functions.
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/helpers.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides a collection of general-purpose utility functions for common tasks like joining class names, grouping arrays, calculating sums, debouncing functions, sorting arrays, filtering by date range, and generating aggregated data.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Imports `clsx` for joining class names.
- `cn`: Joins class names using `clsx`.
- `groupByKey`: Groups an array of objects based on the value of a specified key.
- `calculateTotal`: Calculates the sum of values for a specified key in an array of objects. Defaults to summing the 'total' key. Handles non-numeric values by treating them as 0.
- `debounce`: Creates a debounced version of a function.
- `sortByKey`: Sorts an array of objects by a specified key and order ('asc' or 'desc'). Returns a new sorted array.
- `filterByDateRange`: Filters an array of objects to include only those whose date value (at a specified key) falls within a given date range. Uses `new Date()` constructor for date parsing, which can be unreliable for strings.
- `generateMonthlyData`: Aggregates data from an array of objects by month, summing values for a specified value key. Returns an array of objects with 'month' (YYYY-MM) and 'value'.
- `formatFileSize`: Formats a file size in bytes into a human-readable string (e.g., "10.5 KB"). Note: This function is also present in `fileHelpers.js`.
- Exports all utility functions.
- Exports a default object containing all utility functions.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file serves as a dumping ground for various utility functions that don't fit neatly into other categories like date or currency. It includes functions for UI-related tasks (`cn`), data manipulation (`groupByKey`, `calculateTotal`, `sortByKey`, `filterByDateRange`, `generateMonthlyData`), performance optimization (`debounce`), and file size formatting (`formatFileSize`). The `groupByKey` and aggregation functions are useful for data processing and reporting. The `debounce` function is a standard pattern for limiting the rate of function calls.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- There is a duplicate `formatFileSize` function defined in `src/shared/utils/fileHelpers.js`. This duplication should be resolved, and the version in `fileHelpers.js` should likely be kept as it's more related to file operations.
- The `filterByDateRange` function uses the `new Date()` constructor for parsing date strings, which is unreliable and can lead to unexpected behavior for various date formats. It should use a robust date parsing method (like `parseISO` or `parse` from `date-fns`, which is used in `date.js`).
- Error handling is minimal, primarily relying on `parseFloat` returning `NaN` and being treated as 0 in `calculateTotal`. More explicit error handling or input validation could be beneficial.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- The `generateMonthlyData` function assumes a specific date format or parsable date string at the `dateKey`.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Remove the duplicate `formatFileSize` function.
- Refactor `filterByDateRange` to use a reliable date parsing method from `date-fns` (already a dependency in `date.js`).
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.
- Add more robust input validation and error handling.
- Consider organizing these utilities into more specific files if the collection grows significantly (e.g., data processing utilities, array utilities).

## 📄 File: src/shared/utils/validation.js

### 🔍 Purpose
Provides utility functions for validating common data inputs like email, password, phone number, name, and amount, as well as a general required field check.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- `validateEmail`: Validates email format using a basic regex. Returns an object with `isValid` boolean and an `error` string or null.
- `validatePassword`: Validates password complexity based on length and character requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). Returns an object with `isValid` boolean and a comma-separated `error` string or null.
- `validatePhoneNumber`: Validates phone number format using a basic regex (E.164 format). Returns a boolean.
- `validateName`: Validates name format using a basic regex (letters and spaces, 2-30 characters). Returns a boolean.
- `validateAmount`: Validates if an amount is a valid positive number. Handles null, undefined, and empty string inputs. Returns an object with `isValid` boolean and an `error` string or null.
- `validateRequired`: Checks if a value is present (not null, undefined, or empty string). Returns an object with `isValid` boolean and an `error` string or null.
- Exports all six validation functions.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This file centralizes input validation logic using regular expressions and basic checks. Each function takes an input value and returns a result indicating whether the input is valid and, for some, a specific error message if not. The password validation provides multiple specific error messages. The phone number and name validations use basic regex patterns. `validateAmount` checks for numeric value and positivity. `validateRequired` is a general check for non-empty values.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The regex patterns for email, phone number, and name are basic and may not cover all valid formats or international variations. More robust validation might require more complex regex or dedicated validation libraries.
- The password validation returns a single comma-separated string of errors. It might be more user-friendly to return an array of error messages.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for function parameters or return types (though JSDoc is present).
- Error messages are hardcoded strings. For internationalization, these should be externalized (e.g., using a localization library).
- The validation functions are independent. There's no mechanism for combining multiple validations for a single input or for validating entire forms.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Add TypeScript types for all functions and their parameters/return values.
- Consider using a dedicated validation library (like Yup, Zod, Joi) for more robust and flexible validation schemas, especially for complex forms.
- Externalize error messages for internationalization.
- Modify `validatePassword` to return an array of error strings for better handling in UI.
- Explore adding functions for composing validations or validating form objects if needed.
