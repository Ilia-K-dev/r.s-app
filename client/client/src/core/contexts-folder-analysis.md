This document provides a detailed file-level analysis of the `client/src/core/contexts/` directory, which contains React Context definitions for managing global state.

## üìÑ File: src/core/contexts/AuthContext.js

### üîç Purpose
This file defines a React Context (`AuthContext`) and a Provider component (`AuthProvider`) for managing the application's authentication state (the current user and loading status) using Firebase Authentication. It also provides a basic `useAuth` hook for consuming the context.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Imports `React`, `createContext`, `useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect`.
- Imports `auth` from Firebase config (`../config/firebase`).
- Imports `onAuthStateChanged` from `firebase/auth`.
- `AuthContext`: Creates a React Context with a default value object containing `user` (null), `setUser` (a no-op function), and `loading` (true).
- `AuthProvider`: A functional component that wraps its `children`.
    - Uses `useState` to manage `user` (initially null) and `loading` (initially true) states.
    - Uses `useEffect` to subscribe to Firebase Auth state changes using `onAuthStateChanged`. The callback updates the `user` state and sets `loading` to false when the auth state changes.
    - The `useEffect` returns an unsubscribe function for cleanup.
    - Defines the `value` object provided to the `AuthContext.Provider`, containing the current `user`, `setUser` (the state setter), and `loading`.
    - Renders `AuthContext.Provider` with the `value` prop, wrapping `children`.
- `useAuth`: A simple hook that calls `useContext(AuthContext)` to provide access to the context value.
- Exports `AuthContext`, `AuthProvider`, and `useAuth`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `AuthContext` is created to hold the authentication state. The `AuthProvider` component is designed to be placed high in the component tree (typically near the root) to make the authentication state available to all descendant components. Inside `AuthProvider`, a `useEffect` hook subscribes to Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` event. This listener is the primary mechanism for updating the `user` and `loading` states whenever the user's authentication status changes (e.g., login, logout, initial load). The `loading` state is used to indicate when the initial authentication check is in progress. The `useAuth` hook is a standard pattern for easily accessing the context value within functional components, providing the current user object, the ability to manually set the user (though typically Firebase handles this), and the loading status.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The `setUser` function from `useState` is exposed directly in the context value. While it works, it's generally better practice to expose only the necessary functions for interacting with the auth state (like login, logout, signup) rather than the raw state setter, as this encapsulates the state management logic within the provider or a dedicated hook.
- The `useAuth` hook is very basic and doesn't include checks for being used outside the provider or provide convenience methods for auth operations (like login, logout). A more comprehensive `useAuth` hook would typically live in a `hooks/` directory and include these features, using the context internally.
- Error handling for Firebase operations (like `onAuthStateChanged` errors, though less common) is not explicitly shown here.
- No explicit type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for the context value or hook return type (though JSDoc is present).

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Create a more comprehensive `useAuth` hook in `src/shared/hooks/` that consumes the `AuthContext` internally and provides methods like `login`, `logout`, `signup`, etc., which interact with the Firebase `auth` instance. This hook should also include the check for being used outside the `AuthProvider`.
- Consider removing `setUser` from the context value exposed by the `AuthProvider` and instead manage state updates internally within the provider or the dedicated `useAuth` hook.
- Add TypeScript types for the context value, provider props, and hook return type.
- Add basic error handling for Firebase auth state changes if necessary.

## üìÑ File: src/core/contexts/ToastContext.js

### üîç Purpose
This file defines a React Context (`ToastContext`) and a Provider component (`ToastProvider`) for managing and displaying global toast notifications across the application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Imports `React`, `createContext`, `useState`, `useCallback`.
- Imports `X` icon from `lucide-react`.
- `ToastContext`: Creates a React Context with a default value object containing a `showToast` no-op function.
- `ToastProvider`: A functional component that wraps its `children`.
    - Uses `useState` to manage an array of `toasts`.
    - `showToast`: A memoized function (`useCallback`) that adds a new toast object (with a unique ID, message, type, and duration) to the `toasts` state. It also sets a `setTimeout` to automatically remove the toast after the specified duration.
    - `removeToast`: A memoized function (`useCallback`) that removes a toast from the `toasts` state based on its ID.
    - Provides the `showToast` function to the `ToastContext.Provider`.
    - Renders `ToastContext.Provider` wrapping `children`.
    - Renders a fixed container `div` at the bottom right of the screen for displaying toasts.
    - Maps over the `toasts` array to render each toast message.
    - Each rendered toast includes dynamic styling based on its `type` and a close button using the `X` icon that calls `removeToast`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `ToastContext` is created to provide the `showToast` function globally. The `ToastProvider` component manages the list of active toasts in its state. The `showToast` function, exposed via the context, allows any component to trigger a toast notification by adding it to the provider's state. Each toast is given a unique ID and a timer is set to automatically remove it after a default or specified duration. The `removeToast` function allows manual dismissal. The provider renders a dedicated area outside the main application flow (fixed position, high z-index) to display the toasts by mapping over the `toasts` array. Styling is applied to toasts based on their type (success, error, info, warning).

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The unique ID generation for toasts uses `Date.now()`. While simple, this could potentially lead to duplicate IDs if multiple toasts are triggered within the same millisecond, although this is unlikely in most practical scenarios. A more robust ID generation method (like a counter or a dedicated library) could be used.
- Styling for toasts is directly embedded using Tailwind classes within the JSX.
- Accessibility: Toast notifications should ideally have `aria-live` regions to announce their presence to screen readers. The current implementation lacks these accessibility attributes.
- No explicit prop type validation (e.g., using TypeScript) for the `showToast` function parameters or the structure of toast objects (though JSDoc is present).
- The default duration is hardcoded.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Add `aria-live` regions to the toast container for improved accessibility.
- Consider a more robust unique ID generation method for toasts.
- Add TypeScript types for the context value, provider props, and toast object structure.
- Consider making the default duration configurable via a prop on the `ToastProvider`.
- Consider a more flexible styling approach if the design system evolves.
