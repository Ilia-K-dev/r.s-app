## üìÑ File: ErrorBoundary.jsx

### üîç Purpose
This component serves as a React Error Boundary to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application. It also integrates with Sentry for error reporting.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports `ErrorBoundary` as a React class component.
- Uses `constructor` to initialize state with `hasError: false`.
- Implements `static getDerivedStateFromError(error)` to update state when an error is caught.
- Implements `componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo)` to log the error to the console and send it to Sentry using `Sentry.captureException` and `Sentry.withScope`.
- The `render` method conditionally renders a fallback UI ("Something went wrong...") if `hasError` is true, otherwise renders its children.
- Imports `React` and `* as Sentry` from `@sentry/react`.

### üß† Logic Overview
The `ErrorBoundary` component utilizes React's error boundary lifecycle methods. `getDerivedStateFromError` is called after an error is thrown in a child component, updating the component's state to indicate an error has occurred. `componentDidCatch` is called after the error is caught, allowing the component to perform side effects like logging the error. The `render` method checks the `hasError` state; if true, it renders a simple error message, preventing the application from crashing. It also sends detailed error information to Sentry for monitoring and debugging.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- The fallback UI is very basic and not styled using the application's design system components.
- The error message "Something went wrong." is generic and not localized.
- The component logs to the console and Sentry, but doesn't offer a way for the user to see error details or report the issue manually.
- The Sentry integration assumes Sentry is initialized elsewhere in the application.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- Use the application's design system components for the fallback UI to maintain a consistent look and feel.
- Implement internationalization (i18n) for the error message.
- Consider providing a way for users to view basic error details (in a user-friendly format) or a button to submit a support ticket/report.
- Ensure Sentry is properly configured and initialized before the ErrorBoundary is used.
- Add PropTypes for `children`.

## üìÑ File: LanguageSwitcher.tsx

### üîç Purpose
This component provides a simple UI element to switch between English and Hebrew languages in the application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents
- Exports `LanguageSwitcher` functional component (TypeScript).
- Uses `useTranslation` hook from `react-i18next` to access translation functionality (`i18n`).
- Imports `Globe` icon from `lucide-react`.
- Gets the `currentLanguage` from `i18n.language`.
- Implements `toggleLanguage` function to switch the language between 'he' and 'en' and update the `document.documentElement.dir` for RTL/LTR support.
- Renders a button with a Globe icon and the name of the *other* language (English if current is Hebrew, and vice versa).

### üß† Logic Overview
The component uses the `react-i18next` hook `useTranslation` to interact with the internationalization (i18n) system. It reads the current language and provides a `toggleLanguage` function. When the button is clicked, `toggleLanguage` determines the new language based on the current one and calls `i18n.changeLanguage` to update the language. It also updates the `dir` attribute of the `<html>` element to handle Right-To-Left (RTL) layout for Hebrew. The button's text dynamically displays the language the user can switch *to*.

### ‚ùå Problems or Gaps
- Only supports switching between two hardcoded languages ('en' and 'he'). It would need modification to support more languages.
- The component directly manipulates `document.documentElement.dir`, which is generally acceptable for language switching but could potentially be managed within a more centralized theme or layout context if the application has complex layout requirements.
- The component assumes `react-i18next` is set up and initialized elsewhere in the application.

### üîÑ Suggestions for Improvement
- If more languages are needed, refactor the component to handle a list of available languages, perhaps fetched from a configuration or context.
- Consider if the `document.documentElement.dir` manipulation should be part of a broader theme or layout management system.
- Add PropTypes or use TypeScript interfaces to clearly define any props if the component were to accept them in the future.
