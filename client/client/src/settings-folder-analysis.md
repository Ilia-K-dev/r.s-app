## 📄 File: CategorySettings.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component provides a UI for users to manage their custom categories, including adding new categories, editing existing ones, and deleting categories.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `CategorySettings` functional component.
- Uses `useState` to manage the state of the new category form (`newCategory`), the category being edited (`editingCategory`), and validation errors (`validationError`).
- Uses `useCategories` hook to fetch categories and access `addCategory`, `updateCategory`, and `deleteCategory` functions.
- Uses `useToast` hook for displaying notifications.
- Implements `handleAddSubmit` for adding a new category.
- Implements `handleEditSubmit` for saving changes to an edited category.
- Implements `handleDelete` for deleting a category.
- Uses `useToast` hook for displaying notifications.
- Uses `lucide-react` for icons (`Tag`, `Plus`, `Trash`, `Edit`, `Save`, `X`).
- Implements `handleAddSubmit` for adding a new category, including basic name validation.
- Implements `handleEditSubmit` for saving changes to an edited category, including basic name validation.
- Implements `handleDelete` for deleting a category with a confirmation prompt.
- Manages local state for the new category form (`newCategory`), the category being edited (`editingCategory`), and validation errors (`validationError`).
- Renders a `Card` containing forms for adding and editing categories, and a list of existing categories.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component fetches categories using the `useCategories` hook. It provides forms for adding and editing categories. When adding a category, it validates the name and calls `addCategory` from the hook. When editing, it updates the local `editingCategory` state and calls `updateCategory` on save. Deletion is handled with a confirmation prompt before calling `deleteCategory`. Toast notifications are used to provide user feedback on these operations. The UI conditionally renders either the category display or the edit form based on the `editingCategory` state.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- Basic string validation for category name is present, but could be more robust (e.g., checking for duplicate names).
- Color input is a standard HTML input; could potentially use a more user-friendly color picker component.
- Error handling is basic; just shows a toast with the error message. More specific error handling or user guidance might be beneficial.
- The confirmation prompt for deletion uses the native `window.confirm`, which is generally not preferred for a consistent UI/UX.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement more comprehensive validation, including checking for duplicate category names before attempting to add or update.
- Replace the native color input with a custom or library-provided color picker component for better styling and user experience.
- Enhance error handling to provide more specific feedback to the user.
- Replace `window.confirm` with a custom modal or dialog component for delete confirmation.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety.

## 📄 File: ColorCustomizer.jsx

### 🔍 Purpose
This component allows users to customize the application's theme colors using a color picker.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `ColorCustomizer` functional component.
- Imports `HexColorPicker` from `react-colorful`.
- Imports `Button` from `@/design-system/components/Button`.
- Receives `theme` object and `onThemeChange` function as props.
- Defines `colorAreas` array with keys, labels (in Hebrew), and descriptions (in Hebrew) for different theme color properties.
- Renders a section title "התאמה אישית של צבעים" (Color Customization).
- Maps over `colorAreas` to render a color preview, label, description, and `HexColorPicker` for each theme color.
- Renders a "אפס לברירת מחדל" (Reset to Default) button that calls `onThemeChange('reset')`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component displays a color picker for several predefined theme color areas (primary, secondary, accent, background). It receives the current `theme` object and an `onThemeChange` callback function. When a user selects a new color using the `HexColorPicker`, the `onChange` event triggers `onThemeChange`, passing the color area key and the new color value. A "Reset to Default" button is also provided, which calls `onThemeChange` with the argument 'reset'.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The labels and descriptions for color areas are hardcoded in Hebrew, which might not be suitable for a multi-language application.
- The component assumes the structure of the `theme` object and the behavior of `onThemeChange`.
- The import path for `Button` (`@/design-system/components/Button`) uses an alias (`@`) which is not standard React or Node.js and relies on specific build configurations (like Webpack or Babel aliases).

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement internationalization (i18n) for the hardcoded Hebrew strings.
- Define PropTypes or use TypeScript to clearly define the expected structure of the `theme` prop and the signature of the `onThemeChange` prop.
- Ensure the `@` alias for the design system components is properly configured in the project's build setup, or consider using relative paths or a standard package structure if possible.

## 📄 File: ExportSettings.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component provides a UI for users to export their receipt data in various formats and with different filtering options.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `ExportSettings` functional component.
- Uses `useState` for `loading`, `error`, and `exportOptions` state.
- Uses `useToast` hook for displaying notifications.
- Defines `formats` array for export format options (CSV, JSON, PDF).
- Defines `dateRanges` array for date filtering options.
- Implements `handleExport` function to simulate data export (currently just a simulated delay and toast).
- Renders a `Card` containing dropdowns for format and date range, a checkbox for including images, and buttons for downloading a template and exporting data.
- Displays an `Alert` if there is an export error.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component allows users to select an export format (CSV, JSON, PDF), a date range, and whether to include images. It maintains the selected options in the `exportOptions` state. The `handleExport` function is triggered when the "Export Data" button is clicked. Currently, this function only simulates an asynchronous operation and shows a success or error toast. A real implementation would involve calling an API or service to generate and download the export file based on the selected options. A "Download Template" button is also present, which simply shows a toast.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The core export logic (`handleExport`) is not implemented; it's just a placeholder simulation.
- The "Download Template" button also lacks implementation.
- There is no actual file download mechanism in place.
- The "Custom Range" date option is available in the dropdown but there is no UI or logic to select custom start and end dates.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement the actual data fetching and export logic within `handleExport`, potentially using a dedicated service.
- Implement the logic for the "Download Template" button.
- Integrate a file download mechanism (e.g., creating a blob and using a link, or handling server-side file responses).
- Add UI elements (like date pickers) and logic to support the "Custom Range" date option.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety.

## 📄 File: FeatureToggles.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component provides an administrative interface for viewing and managing feature flags within the application. It allows users with sufficient permissions to enable or disable specific features and view a basic audit log of changes.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `FeatureToggles` functional component.
- Imports functions from `../../../core/config/featureFlags` (`isFeatureEnabled`, `enableFeature`, `disableFeature`, `getAllFeatureFlags`).
- Imports `openDB` from `idb` to access IndexedDB for the audit log.
- Uses `useState` for `allFlags`, `auditLog`, and `canEdit` state.
- Uses `useEffect` to load flags and audit log on component mount and listen for storage changes.
- Defines `featureFlagDescriptions` object (currently with limited descriptions).
- Includes a placeholder `canEditFeatureFlags` function for permission checking.
- Implements `loadAuditLog` to fetch the last audit entry from IndexedDB.
- Implements `handleToggleChange` to enable/disable features using the imported functions and update state/audit log.
- Renders a title "Feature Toggles Admin".
- Displays a permission message if the user cannot edit flags.
- Lists available flags with their status (Enabled/Disabled), name, and description, along with Enable/Disable buttons.
- Includes placeholder sections for comprehensive admin controls, flag change history (currently only shows the last change), flag analytics, and auto-disable system status.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component fetches all available feature flags and their current status using `getAllFeatureFlags`. It also attempts to load the last feature flag change from an IndexedDB audit log. The UI displays each flag with its status and description. If the user has editing permissions (determined by the `canEditFeatureFlags` placeholder), they can click buttons to enable or disable flags, which calls the corresponding functions from `featureFlags.js`. After a change, the component reloads the flags and the audit log. It also listens for `storage` events to update if flags are changed in another tab.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `canEditFeatureFlags` function is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with actual user permission logic.
- The `featureFlagDescriptions` object is incomplete and hardcoded; it should ideally be part of a centralized configuration or fetched dynamically.
- The audit log implementation is very basic, only storing and displaying the last change. A full audit log requires a more robust IndexedDB structure.
- Many sections of the UI are placeholders for future functionality (comprehensive controls, analytics, auto-disable status).
- The component relies on direct access to IndexedDB (`openDB`), which might be better abstracted into a dedicated service or hook.
- Error handling for IndexedDB operations is basic (`console.error`).

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement proper user permission checks in `canEditFeatureFlags`.
- Centralize feature flag descriptions, possibly in the same configuration file as the flags themselves, and load them dynamically.
- Enhance the audit log functionality by creating a dedicated object store in IndexedDB to store a history of changes.
- Implement the placeholder sections for more comprehensive feature flag management, analytics, and auto-disable features.
- Abstract IndexedDB interactions into a service or hook to keep the component cleaner.
- Improve error handling for IndexedDB and feature flag operations.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety.

## 📄 File: NotificationSettings.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component provides a user interface for managing notification preferences, allowing users to opt-in or out of different notification channels and types.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `NotificationSettings` functional component.
- Uses `useState` for `loading`, `error`, `success`, and `preferences` state.
- Uses `useEffect` to fetch initial notification preferences when the user object is available.
- Uses `useAuth` hook to access the current `user`.
- Uses `useToast` hook for displaying notifications.
- Imports `Card`, `Button`, `Switch`, and `Alert` components.
- Imports `Save` and `Bell` icons from `lucide-react`.
- Defines a `handleSubmit` function to simulate saving preferences to the backend.
- Renders a `Card` containing sections for Notification Channels (Email, Push) and Notification Types (Receipt Processed, Monthly Reports, Low Stock Alerts), each with `Switch` components.
- Displays `Alert` messages for errors and success.
- Includes a "Save Preferences" button.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component fetches initial notification preferences for the logged-in user using a `useEffect` hook (currently simulated with dummy data). It maintains these preferences in the `preferences` state, using `Switch` components to allow the user to toggle each option. When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function is called. This function currently simulates saving the preferences to a backend with a delay and shows a success or error toast.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The fetching and saving of notification preferences are simulated; the actual backend integration is missing.
- The component relies on the `useAuth` hook to get the user, but the dummy data fetching doesn't use the user object.
- Error handling is basic, just showing a generic error message.
- Success message is hardcoded instead of being tied to the `success` state.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Implement the actual logic to fetch and save user notification preferences from/to the backend.
- Ensure the data fetching and saving logic correctly uses the `user` object from the `useAuth` hook.
- Improve error handling to provide more specific feedback to the user based on backend responses.
- Ensure the success message is conditionally rendered based on the `success` state and potentially includes more details.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety.

## 📄 File: ProfileSettings.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component provides a user interface for users to view and update their profile information, such as display name and profile picture URL.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `ProfileSettings` functional component.
- Uses `useState` for `loading`, `error`, `success`, and `formData` state.
- Uses `useEffect` to populate the form with the current user's profile data when the user object is available.
- Uses `useAuth` hook to access the current `user` and the `updateProfile` function.
- Uses `useToast` hook for displaying notifications.
- Imports `Card`, `Input`, `Button`, and `Alert` components.
- Imports `User`, `Mail`, and `Save` icons from `lucide-react`.
- Defines a `handleSubmit` function to update the user's profile.
- Renders a `Card` containing input fields for Display Name, Email (disabled), and Profile Picture URL.
- Displays `Alert` messages for errors and success.
- Includes a "Save Changes" button.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The component fetches the current user's profile information using the `useAuth` hook and populates the form fields in a `useEffect`. The email field is disabled as it cannot be changed through this interface. Users can update their display name and profile picture URL. When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function is called, which uses the `updateProfile` function from the `useAuth` hook to save the changes. Toast notifications are used to provide feedback on the update operation.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The component assumes the structure of the user object provided by `useAuth`.
- Basic error handling; just shows a generic error message from the error object.
- No validation is performed on the input fields before attempting to update the profile.
- The email field is disabled, but there's no clear indication or link for how a user *would* change their email if needed.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Define PropTypes or use TypeScript to clearly define the expected structure of the `user` object.
- Implement more specific error handling based on potential error types from the `updateProfile` function.
- Add input validation (e.g., for display name length, valid URL format for photoURL).
- Consider adding a link or guidance on how users can change their email address if that functionality exists elsewhere in the application or through the authentication provider.

## 📄 File: useSettings.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This custom React hook provides functionality to fetch, update, reset, export, and import user settings, managing the state of settings data, loading status, and errors. It interacts with Firestore for persistent storage and uses client-side caching for performance.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `useSettings` functional hook.
- Imports Firestore functions (`doc`, `getDoc`, `setDoc`, `updateDoc`).
- Imports React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`).
- Imports `db` from `../../../core/config/firebase`.
- Imports `useAuth` hook.
- Imports `errorHandler` utility.
- Imports `getCache`, `setCache`, `invalidateCache` cache utilities.
- Imports `logger` utility.
- Defines `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` object with a comprehensive structure for various setting categories (notifications, display, receipts, reports, categories, privacy).
- Defines JSDoc typedefs for `UserSettings` and `UseSettingsReturn`.
- Uses `useState` to manage `settings`, `loading`, and `error` state.
- Implements `fetchSettings` using `useCallback` to fetch settings from cache or Firestore, initialize default settings if needed, and update cache.
- Implements `updateSettings` using `useCallback` to update settings in Firestore and local state, and manage cache.
- Implements `resetSettings` using `useCallback` to reset settings to default using `updateSettings`.
- Implements `getSetting` using `useCallback` to retrieve a specific setting value by path.
- Implements `exportSettings` using `useCallback` to export current settings to a JSON file.
- Implements `importSettings` using `useCallback` to import settings from a JSON file and update them using `updateSettings`.
- Uses `useEffect` to call `fetchSettings` when the user object changes.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
The `useSettings` hook provides a central point for managing user settings. On component mount or when the user changes, it attempts to fetch settings from a client-side cache. If not found, it fetches from Firestore. If no settings exist in Firestore for the user, it initializes them with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`. The hook provides functions to `updateSettings` (merging new values, optionally for a specific section), `resetSettings` (to defaults), `getSetting` (by path), `exportSettings` (to JSON file), and `importSettings` (from JSON file). All mutations update both Firestore and the local state, and manage the client-side cache. Error handling and logging are integrated using imported utilities.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` object is quite large and defined directly within the hook; it might be better placed in a separate configuration file.
- The cache invalidation strategy (`invalidateCache` after `setCache` in `updateSettings`) seems redundant; `setCache` should be sufficient to update the cached value.
- The `importSettings` function uses nested async logic within `FileReader.onload`, which can make error handling and loading state management slightly more complex.
- The JSDoc typedefs are helpful but could be replaced or complemented by TypeScript for compile-time type checking.
- The dependency arrays for `useCallback` and `useEffect` seem correct, but careful review is needed if the hook's logic changes.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Move `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` to a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `src/core/config/defaultSettings.js`).
- Review and potentially simplify the cache management logic; ensure `setCache` correctly updates the existing cache entry.
- Consider refactoring the `importSettings` logic to use Promises or async/await more directly for cleaner error handling.
- Introduce TypeScript to the project to replace JSDoc for better type safety and developer experience.
- Continuously review and update the dependency arrays for hooks as the logic evolves.

## 📄 File: SettingsPage.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This component serves as the main page for user settings, aggregating various settings components into a single view.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `SettingsPage` functional component.
- Imports `Card` from `../../../shared/components/ui/Card`.
- Imports `ProfileSettings`, `CategorySettings`, `NotificationSettings`, and `ExportSettings` components from `../components/`.
- Renders a main heading "Settings".
- Renders a grid layout containing instances of `ProfileSettings`, `CategorySettings`, `NotificationSettings`, and `ExportSettings`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This component is primarily a container and layout component. It doesn't contain complex logic itself but is responsible for rendering the different settings sections by including the relevant components. It provides a simple structure with a main heading and a grid to arrange the imported settings components.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The component is very basic and could potentially be enhanced with features like navigation between settings sections (e.g., using tabs or a sidebar) if the number of settings grows.
- There's no error handling or loading state management at the page level, although individual settings components might handle their own.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Consider adding navigation (tabs, sidebar) if more settings sections are added in the future to improve user experience.
- Implement basic page-level error boundaries or loading indicators if needed, although component-level handling might be sufficient.
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety if props were passed down (currently none are).

## 📄 File: settingsService.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This service file provides functions for interacting with user settings data stored in Firestore.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `getUserSettings` asynchronous function to fetch settings for a given user ID.
- Exports `updateUserSettings` asynchronous function to update settings for a given user ID, merging the provided settings with existing ones.
- Imports `db` from `../../../core/config/firebase`.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
This service acts as a data access layer for user settings in Firestore. `getUserSettings` takes a user ID, queries the 'settings' collection for a document matching the user ID, and returns the data if the document exists, otherwise returns null. `updateUserSettings` takes a user ID and a settings object, and uses `set` with `merge: true` to update the corresponding user's settings document in the 'settings' collection. Both functions include basic error handling by throwing a new Error if the Firestore operation fails.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The error handling is very basic, just throwing a generic error message. More specific error handling or integration with a centralized error handling utility would be beneficial.
- The Firestore collection path (`'settings'`) and document structure (`doc(userId)`) are hardcoded within the functions.
- There's no validation of the incoming `settings` object in `updateUserSettings`.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Integrate with the `errorHandler` utility (already imported in `useSettings.js`) for more consistent and informative error handling.
- Centralize Firestore paths or use constants for better maintainability.
- Consider adding basic validation for the `settings` object in `updateUserSettings` if necessary.
- Add JSDoc or TypeScript for better type safety and documentation of function parameters and return types.

## 📄 File: settingsHelpers.js

### 🔍 Purpose
This utility file provides helper functions related to settings, including defining default settings and functions for getting and setting nested setting values using dot notation.

### ⚙️ Key Contents
- Exports `getDefaultSettings` function which returns a basic default settings object.
- Exports `getSettingValue` function which retrieves a nested value from a settings object using a dot notation key.
- Exports `setSettingValue` function which sets a nested value in a settings object using a dot notation key.

### 🧠 Logic Overview
`getDefaultSettings` simply returns a hardcoded object representing a minimal set of default user settings. `getSettingValue` takes a settings object and a dot notation string (e.g., 'notifications.email') and traverses the object to return the corresponding value. `setSettingValue` takes a settings object, a dot notation string, and a value, and modifies the settings object in place to set the value at the specified nested path.

### ❌ Problems or Gaps
- The `getDefaultSettings` object defined here is significantly less comprehensive than the `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` object found in `useSettings.js`. This inconsistency is problematic.
- The `setSettingValue` function modifies the original settings object directly, which can lead to unexpected side effects if the caller expects immutability.
- There's no error handling in `getSettingValue` or `setSettingValue` if the provided path is invalid or a property in the path is not an object.

### 🔄 Suggestions for Improvement
- Harmonize the `getDefaultSettings` definition across the application; ideally, there should be a single source of truth for default settings. The more comprehensive `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `useSettings.js` seems more appropriate.
- Refactor `setSettingValue` to return a new, updated settings object (immutability) instead of modifying the original object in place.
- Add error handling to `getSettingValue` and `setSettingValue` to gracefully handle invalid paths (e.g., return `undefined` or throw a specific error).
- Add JSDoc or TypeScript for better type safety and documentation.
