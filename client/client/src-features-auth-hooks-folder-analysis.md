- **Status**: Contains Authentication Hooks.

## File: useAuth.js
- **Purpose**: A custom React hook that provides access to authentication state and functions.
- **Key Functions / Components / Logic**:
    - Consumes the `AuthContext` to get the current user and loading state.
    - Uses the `useToast` hook to display notifications.
    - Manages a local `loading` state for authentication operations.
    - Provides functions for:
        - `loginAnonymously`: Signs in a user anonymously using Firebase Auth.
        - `login`: Signs in a user with email and password using Firebase Auth. Includes error handling for common authentication errors.
        - `register`: Creates a new user with email and password using Firebase Auth and updates their profile with a display name. Includes error handling for common registration errors.
        - `logout`: Signs out the current user using Firebase Auth.
        - `resetPassword`: Sends a password reset email using Firebase Auth. Includes error handling.
        - `updateUserProfile`: Updates the current user's profile using Firebase Auth.
    - Displays success and error messages using toast notifications.
- **Dependencies**: `react`, `firebase/auth`, `../../../core/config/firebase`, `../../../core/contexts/AuthContext`, `../../../shared/hooks/useToast`.
- **Complexity/Notes**: Encapsulates Firebase authentication logic within a React hook. Provides a convenient interface for components to perform authentication operations. Includes basic error handling and user feedback via toasts.
- **Bugs / Dead Code / Comments**: None apparent.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Consider adding more detailed error handling or logging for authentication errors. Ensure consistency in error message formatting and content.
