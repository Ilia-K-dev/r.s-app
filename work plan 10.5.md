Receipt Scanner App Refactoring Work Plan: Firebase SDK Direct Integration
Overview
This enhanced work plan outlines the systematic approach for refactoring the Receipt Scanner app to use Firebase SDK directly, eliminating the dependency on the Express backend server. The plan focuses on cost efficiency, maintaining functionality, and ensuring security while minimizing development time.
Strategic Approach
We'll take a feature-by-feature approach, completing each module before moving to the next. This ensures we have working functionality throughout the process and allows for incremental testing.

Human-EDI Collaboration Protocol
For all tasks involving environment setup, command execution, or new directory creation, follow this protocol:

EDI (Cline): Document the exact requirement with specific details
Human: Execute the required action and confirm completion
EDI (Cline): Proceed with implementation after confirmation

Tasks requiring human intervention:

Environment Setup: Creating new directories, initializing repositories
Command Execution: Running npm/yarn commands, starting servers/emulators
Testing Operations: Running Firebase emulator suite, executing test commands
Directory Navigation: Moving between project folders or creating new workspace areas
Dependency Installation: Installing new npm packages or updating existing ones
Service Configuration: Setting up Firebase project configurations or environment variables
Emulator Configuration: Setting up and starting Firebase emulators

For each intervention request, Cline will:

Clearly state what action is needed
Provide specific command(s) if applicable
Explain the purpose of the request
Wait for human confirmation before proceeding

Tools and Resources for Cost-Efficient Development
Firebase Emulator Suite

Human setup required: Install and configure Firebase Emulator Suite
Use for local testing of Firestore, Storage, and Auth
Eliminates cloud usage costs during development
Provides rapid feedback on security rule effectiveness

Tesseract.js

Use for client-side OCR to avoid Cloud Vision API costs
Preprocess images client-side for better results
Consider the wasm version for better performance

Firestore Batch Operations

Use batched writes for multiple document updates
Reduces the number of write operations (cost savings)
Improves performance for bulk operations

Efficient Query Patterns

Use compound queries where possible
Implement pagination for large collections
Create composite indexes only when necessary

Local Storage / IndexedDB

Cache frequently accessed data
Implement offline-first approach where appropriate
Reduce read operations to minimize costs

Firebase Debugging

Human setup required: Enable Firebase debug mode during development
Monitor actual read/write operations in the console
Use for detecting excessive operations


Implementation Guidelines for Cost Efficiency
Start small and test often

Implement one function at a time
Test thoroughly before moving to the next
This prevents complex debugging across multiple changes

Prioritize critical user flows

Focus first on receipt scanning and management
Then move to inventory and analytics
This ensures core functionality works first

Leverage existing code

Keep business logic and UI components intact
Only refactor the data access layer
Maintain the same public API for services

Monitor Firebase usage

Check Firestore usage stats in Firebase Console
Be mindful of read/write operations
Optimize queries that run frequently

Document as you go

Add detailed comments to refactored code
Note any subtleties in Firebase implementations
Track improvements or compromises made


Testing Strategy
Unit Testing

Create unit tests for each refactored service
Mock Firebase services using jest.mock
Test both success and error cases

Security Rules Testing

Human setup required: Set up Firebase rules testing environment
Create test cases for each collection
Test with authenticated and unauthenticated users
Test with different user IDs to verify ownership rules

Integration Testing

Test the complete flow from UI to Firebase and back
Verify data consistency across features
Test offline capabilities and synchronization

Performance Testing

Create performance test scripts
Measure and document read/write operations
Compare performance before and after refactoring
